The Upanishads (Devanagari: à¤‰à¤ªà¤¨à¤¿à¤·à¤¦à¥, IAST: upaniá¹£ad, also spelled "Upanisad") are Hindu scriptures that constitute the core teachings of Vedanta.[1] They do not belong to any particular period of Sanskrit literature: the oldest, such as the Brhadaranyaka and Chandogya Upanishads, date to the late Brahmana period (around the middle of the first millennium BCE), while the latest were composed in the medieval and early modern period. The Upanishads have exerted an important influence on the rest of Hindu Philosophy, and were collectively considered one of the 100 Most Influential Books Ever Written by the British poet Martin Seymour-Smith.
The philosopher and commentator Shankara is thought to have composed commentaries on eleven mukhya or principal Upanishads, those that are generally regarded as the oldest, spanning the late Vedic and Mauryan periods. The Muktika Upanishad (predates 1656) contains a list of 108 canonical Upanishads[2] and lists itself as the final one. Although there are a wide variety of philosophical positions propounded in the Upanishads, commentators since Shankara have usually followed him in seeing idealist monism as the dominant one.[3][4]
Dara Shikoh (d. 1659), son of the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan, translated fifty Upanishads into Persian. Max MÃ¼ller (1879) was aware of 170. Sadhale, in his massive verse index Upaniá¹£ad-vÄkya-mahÄ-koÅ›a, has drawn on 223 different extant texts that call themselves by this name.[5] Additionally, parts of earlier texts, of Brahmanas or passages of the Vedas themselves, are sometimes considered Upanishads.

The Sanskrit term upaniá¹£ad derives from upa- (nearby), ni- (at the proper place, down) and sad, that is "sitting down near" a teacher in order to receive instruction[6] - "laying siege" to the teacher, as Schayer puts it.[7] Monier-Williams adds that "according to native authorities upanishad means 'setting to rest ignorance by revealing the knowledge of the supreme spirit');..."[8] A gloss of the term upaniá¹£ad based on Shankara's commentary on the Kaá¹­ha and Bá¹›hadÄraá¹‡yaka Upanishads equates it with Ä€tmavidyÄ, that is "knowledge of the Self", or BrahmavidyÄ "knowledge of Brahma".[citation needed] Other dictionary meanings include "esoteric doctrine" and "secret doctrine".

The Upanishads speak of an universal spirit (Brahman) and of an individual soul (Atman),[9] and at times assert the identity of both. Brahman is the ultimate, both transcendent and immanent, the absolute infinite existence, the sum total of all that ever is, was, or shall be. The mystical nature and intense philosophical bent of the Upanishads has led to their explication in numerous manners, giving birth to three main schools of Vedanta. Shankara's exegesis of the Upanishads does not describe Brahman as the God in a monotheistic sense. His philosophy is named advaita, "not two" as opposed to dvaita, founded by Madhvacharya, which holds that Brahman is ultimately a personal God, to be aligned with Vishnu, or Krishna (brahmano hi pratisthaham, I am the Foundation of Brahman Bhagavad Gita 14.27). The third major school of Vedanta is Vishishtadvaita, founded by Ramanujacharya and it has some aspects in common with the other two.
The ninth chapter of the Taittiriya Upanishad says:
The key phrase of the Upanishads, to Advaita Vedanta, is à¤¤à¤¤à¥ à¤¤à¥à¤µà¤‚ à¤…à¤¿à¤¸ "Tat Tvam Asi" (That thou art). Vedantins believe that in the end, the ultimate, formless, inconceivable Brahman is the same as our soul, Atman. We only have to realize this through discrimination. (However, interpretations of this phrase differ.)[10] Verses 6, 7 & 8 of Isha Upanishad:
The Upanishads also contain the first and most definitive explications of the divine syllable Aum or OM, the cosmic vibration that underlies all existence. The mantra "Aum Shanti Shanti Shanti" (the soundless sound, peace, peace, peace)is often found in the Upanishads. 'Devotion to God' (Sanskrit: bhakti) is foreshadowed in Upanishadic literature, and was later realized by texts such as the Bhagavad Gita.[11]


The following list includes the eleven "principal" (mukhya) Upanishads commented upon[3] by Shankara, and accepted as shruti by most Hindus. Each is associated with one of the four Vedas (Rigveda (á¹šV), Samaveda (SV), White Yajurveda (ÅšYV), Black Yajurveda (KYV), Atharvaveda (AV));
The KauÅ›Ä«tÄki and MaitrÄyaá¹‡i Upanishads are sometimes added. All these date from before the Common Era. From linguistic evidence, the oldest among them are the Bá¹›hadÄraá¹‡yaka and ChÄndogya Upanishads. The JaiminÄ«ya Upaniá¹£adbrÄhmaá¹‡a, belonging to the late Vedic Sanskrit period, may also be included. Of nearly the same age are the Aitareya, Kauá¹£Ä«taki and TaittirÄ«ya Upaniá¹£ads, while the remnant date from the time of transition from Vedic to Classical Sanskrit.
The older Upanishads are associated with Vedic Charanas, Shakhas or schools; the Aitareya and KauÅ›Ä«tÄki Upanishads with the Shakala shakha, the ChÄndogya Upanishad with the Kauthuma shakha, the Kena Upanishad with the Jaiminiya shakha, the Kaá¹­ha Upanishad with the Caraka-Katha shakha, the TaittirÄ«ya and ÅšvetÄÅ›vatara Upanishads with the Taittiriya shakha, the MaitrÄyaá¹‡i Upanishad with the Maitrayani shakha, the Bá¹›hadÄraá¹‡yaka and Äªá¹£a Upanishads with the Vajasaneyi Madhyandina shakha, and the MÄá¹‡á¸Å«kya and Muá¹‡á¸aka Upanishads with the Shaunaka shakha.
In the Muktika Upanishad's list of 108 Upanishads the first 10 are grouped as mukhya "principal". 21 are grouped as SÄmÄnya VedÄnta "common Vedanta", 23 as SannyÄsa, 9 as ShÄkta, 13 as Vaishnava, 14 as Shaiva and 17 as Yoga Upanishads.[12] [13]

Later Upanisads are often highly sectarian: this was "one of the strategies used by sectarian movements to legitimate their own texts through granting them the nominal status of Åšruti."[14] For the most part, the canonical Shakta Upanishads are sectarian tracts reflecting doctrinal and interpretative differences between the two principal sects of Srividya upasana (a major Tantric form of Shaktism). As a result, the many extant listings of "authentic" Shakta Upanisads vary in content, reflecting the sectarian bias of their compilers:
"Past efforts to construct lists of Shakta Upanisads have left us no closer to understanding either their 'location' in Tantric tradition or their place within the Vedic corpus. [...] At stake for the Tantric is not the authority of sruti per se, which remains largely undisputed, but rather its correct interpretation. For non-Tantrics, [it is a text's] Tantric contents that brings into question its identity as an Upanisad. At issue is the text's classification as sruti and thus its inherent authority as Veda." [15]
Of the texts listed in the Muktika Upanishad nine are classified as Shakta Upanishads:
The list excludes several notable and widely used Shakta Upanisads, including the Kaula Upaniá¹£ad, the ÅšrÄ«vidyÄ Upaniá¹£ad and the Åšrichakra Upaniá¹£ad.

The Vedas became known outside of India when the Upanishads were translated from Sanskrit. At first, they were translated into Persian. This was done as a result of Emperor Akbar's liberal religious attitude. [16] The prince Shah Jehan, who was influenced by the Emperor and shared Akbar's viewpoint, had an eldest son named Dara Shikoh. Shikoh was, like his father, a liberal Muslim and wrote a book that attempted to reconcile Islam with Hinduism. In 1640, Dara Shikoh visited Kashmir and met pandits, who told him about the Upanishads. Later, he invited pandits from Benares to come to Delhi, which was under Mughal control, in order to assist him in translating the Upanishads. In 1657, the translation of the Upanishads into Persian was completed. In his translation, known by the name Sirr-e-Akbar (The Greatest Mystery), he states at the Introduction that the work referred to in the Qur'an as the "Kitab al-maknun" or the hidden book is none other than the Upanishads. Two years later, in 1659, his brother Aurangzib, who was a strict Muslim, had him executed under the Sharia law as an apostate from Islam. This may have been a pretext, because Shikoh had been the eldest son and Aurangzib ascended the throne after Shikoh's execution.[17]

In 1775, the French scholar Anquetil Duperron received a manuscript of part of the Upanishads from M. Gentil, who resided at the court of Shula ud daula. Duperron requested the remaining part and then collated the two parts. He translated them into both French and Latin. The French version was never published but the Latin translation was published in 1801. The Latinized title was Oupnek'hat. The German philosopher Schopenhauer read the Latin translation and extravagantly [18] praised it in his main work, The World as Will and Representation, which was published in 1819, as well as in his Parerga and Paralipomena, [19] (1851). He found that the Upanishads accorded with his own philosophy, which taught that the individual is a manifestation of the one basis of reality. For Schopenhauer, that fundamentally real underlying unity is what we know in ourselves as "will." German philosopher Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling praised the mystical and spiritual aspects of the Upanishads. Schelling and other members of the German Idealist group were dissatisfied with Christianity and became fascinated with the Vedas and the Upanishads. Similarlyâ€“minded English and European writers, such as Thomas Carlyle, Victor Cousin, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and Mme. de StaÃ«l, claimed to find deep wisdom in these nonâ€“Western writings. In the United States, the group known as the Transcendentalists were influenced by Schelling's German Idealists. These Americans, such as Emerson and Thoreau, were not satisfied with traditional Christian mythology and therefore embraced Schelling's interpretation of Kant's Transcendental idealism, as well as his celebration of the romantic, exotic, mystical aspect of the Upanishads. As a result of the influence of these writers, the Upanishads gained renown in Western countries.

The Upanishadic thinkers came to consider change as a mere illusion, because it could not be reconciled with a permanent and homogeneous reality. They were therefore led to a complete denial of plurality.[20] According to David Kalupahana, "Although the search for an essential unity of things was crowned with success, philosophy suffered a severe setback as a result of this transcendentalism."
