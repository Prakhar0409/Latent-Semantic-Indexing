Sri Lanka
Sri Lanka, officially the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka (pronounced /ËŒÊƒriËËˆlÉ‘ËÅ‹kÉ™/, Sinhalese: à·à·Šâ€à¶»à·“ à¶½à¶‚à¶šà·à·€, Tamil: à®‡à®²à®™à¯à®•à¯ˆ; known as Ceylon (/sÉªËˆlÉ’n/) before 1972 and as Taprobane (/tÉ™ËˆprÉ’bÉ™ni/) in ancient times) is an island country in South Asia, located about 31 kilometres (19.3 mi) off the southern coast of India. It is home to around twenty million people.
Because of its location in the path of major sea routes, Sri Lanka is a strategic naval link between West Asia and South East Asia, and has been a center of Buddhist religion and culture from ancient times. Today, the country is a multi-religious and multi-ethnic nation, with more than a quarter of the population following faiths other than Buddhism, notably Hinduism, Christianity and Islam. The Sinhalese community forms the majority of the population, with Tamils, who are concentrated in the north and east of the island, forming the largest ethnic minority. Other communities include Moors, Burghers, Kaffirs and the Malays.
Famous for the production and export of tea, coffee, coconuts and rubber, Sri Lanka boasts a progressive and modern industrial economy and the highest per capita income in South Asia. The natural beauty of Sri Lanka's tropical forests, beaches and landscape, as well as its rich cultural heritage, make it a world famous tourist destination.
After over two thousand years of rule by local kingdoms, parts of Sri Lanka were colonized by Portugal and the Netherlands beginning in the 16th century, before the control of the entire country was ceded to the British Empire in 1815. During World War II, Sri Lanka served as an important base for Allied forces in the fight against the Japanese Empire.[5] A nationalist political movement arose in the country in the early 20th century with the aim of obtaining political independence, which was eventually granted by the British after peaceful negotiations in 1948.

In ancient times, Sri Lanka was known by a variety of names: ancient Greek geographers called it Taprobane[6] and Arabs referred to it as Serendib (the origin of the word "serendipity").[7] CeilÃ£o was the name given to Sri Lanka by the Portuguese when they arrived on the island in 1505,[8] which was transliterated into English as Ceylon.[9] In 1972, the official name of the country was changed to "Free, Sovereign and Independent Republic of Sri Lanka" (in Sinhala  Å›rÄ« laá¹ƒkÄ, IPA: [ËŒÊƒÉ¾iËËˆlaÅ‹kaË]; whereas the island itself is referred to as à¶½à¶‚à¶šà·à·€ laá¹ƒkÄva, IPA: [laÅ‹ËˆkaËÊ‹É™], in Tamil à®‡à®²à®™à¯à®•à¯ˆ ilaá¹…kai, iËˆlaÅ‹gai). In 1978 it was changed to "Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka".[10]
The current name is derived from the Sanskrit word lanka, meaning "island",[11] which was also the name of the island as described in the ancient Indian epics Mahabharata and the Ramayana. The word "Sri" is a Sanskrit title meaning sacred.

The island of Sri Lanka lies in the Indian Ocean, to the southwest of the Bay of Bengal and to the southeast of the Arabian Sea. It is separated from the Indian subcontinent by the Gulf of Mannar and the Palk Strait.[12] According to Hindu mythology, a land bridge to the Indian mainland, known as Rama's Bridge, was constructed during the time of Rama by the vanara architect Nala. Often referred to as Adam's Bridge, it now amounts to only a chain of limestone shoals remaining above sea level.[12] According to colonial British reports, this is a natural causeway which was formerly complete, but was breached by a violent storm in 1480.[13] The width of the Palk Strait is small enough for the coast of Sri Lanka to be visible from the furthest point near the Indian town of Rameswaram.[citation needed] The teardrop-shaped island consists mostly of flat-to-rolling coastal plains, with mountains rising only in the south-central part. Amongst these are Adam's Peak (Sri Pada) and the highest point Pidurutalagala, at 2,524 meters (8,281 ft). The Mahaweli River and other major rivers provide fresh water to the population.[14]
Sri Lanka's climate can be described as tropical, and quite hot. Its position between 5 and 10 north latitude endows the country with a warm climate, moderated by ocean winds and considerable moisture.[15]
The mean temperature ranges from a low of 16 Â°C (61 Â°F) in Nuwara Eliya in the Central Highlands (where frost may occur for several days in the winter) to a high of 32 Â°C (90 Â°F) in Trincomalee on the northeast coast (where temperatures may reach 38 Â°C (100 Â°F)). The average yearly temperature for the country as a whole ranges from 28Â° to 30 Â°C (82â€“86 Â°F). Day and night temperatures may vary by 4 to 7 Â°C (7â€“13 Â°F). In January, the coolest month, many people wear coats and sweaters in the highlands and elsewhere. May, the hottest period, precedes the summer monsoon rains. The rainfall pattern is influenced by the monsoon winds of the Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal, which encounter the slopes of the Central Highlands, they unload heavy rains on the mountain slopes and the southwestern sector of the island. Some of the windward slopes receive up to 2,500 millimetres (98 in) of rain per month, but the leeward slopes in the east and northeast receive little rain. Periodic squalls occur and sometimes tropical cyclones bring overcast skies and rains to the southwest, northeast, and eastern parts of the island. Between December to March, monsoon winds come from the northeast, bringing moisture from the Bay of Bengal. Humidity is typically higher in the southwest and mountainous areas and depends on the seasonal patterns of rainfall. At Colombo, for example, daytime humidity stays above 70% all year, rising to almost 90 percent during the monsoon season in June. Anuradhapura experiences a daytime low of 60% during the monsoon month of March, but a high of 79% during the November and December rains. In the highlands, Kandy's daytime humidity usually ranges between 70 and 79%.

The mountains and the southwestern part of the country, known as the "wet zone," receive ample rainfall (an annual average of 2500 millimetres). Most of the southeast, east, and northern parts of the country comprise the "dry zone," which receives between 1200 and 1900 mm (47â€“75 in) of rain annually. Much of the rain in these areas falls from October to January; during the rest of the year there is very little precipitation, and all living creatures must conserve precious moisture. The arid northwest and southeast coasts receive the least amount of rain â€” 600 to 1200 mm (24â€“47 in) per year â€” However, though many say that there are no really dry areas in Sri Lanka, there are many pockets of very dry and abandoned areas where there is little to no rainwater. Varieties of flowering acacias are well adapted to the arid conditions and flourish on the Jaffna Peninsula. Among the trees of the dry-land forests are some valuable species, such as satinwood, ebony, ironwood, and mahogany and teak. In the wet zone, the dominant vegetation of the lowlands is a tropical evergreen forest, with tall trees, broad foliage, and a dense undergrowth of vines and creepers.
Subtropical evergreen forests resembling those of temperate climates flourish in the higher altitudes. Forests at one time covered nearly the entire island, but by the late 20th century lands classified as forests and forest reserves covered around one-third of the land.[16] The Ruhunu National Park in the southeast protects herds of elephant, deer, and peacocks, and the Wilpattu National Park in the northwest preserves the habitats of many water birds, such as storks, pelicans, ibis, and spoonbills. During the Mahaweli Ganga Program of the 1970s and 1980s in northern Sri Lanka, the government set aside four areas of land totaling 1,900 km2 (730 sq mi) as national parks. The island has three biosphere reserves, Hurulu, Sinharaja, and the Kanneliya-Dediyagala-Nakiyadeniya.
The national flower of Sri Lanka is Nil Mahanel (Nymphaeaceae),[17] the national tree is Na (Mesua nagassarium)[18] and the national bird is the Sri Lanka Junglefowl, which is endemic to the country.[19]
