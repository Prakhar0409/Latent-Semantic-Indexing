Emily Dickinson
Emily Elizabeth Dickinson (December 10, 1830â€“ May 15, 1886) was an American poet. Born in Amherst, Massachusetts to a successful family with strong community ties, she lived a mostly introverted and reclusive life. After she studied at the Amherst Academy for seven years in her youth, she spent a short time at Mount Holyoke Female Seminary before returning to her family's house in Amherst. Thought of as an eccentric by the locals, she became known for her penchant for white clothing and her reluctance to greet guests or, later in life, even leave her room. Most of her friendships were therefore carried out by correspondence.
Dickinson was a prolific private poet, though fewer than a dozen of her nearly eighteen hundred poems were published during her lifetime.[1] The work that was published during her lifetime was usually altered significantly by the publishers to fit the conventional poetic rules of the time. Dickinson's poems are unique for the era in which she wrote; they contain short lines, typically lack titles, and often utilize slant rhyme as well as unconventional capitalization and punctuation.[2] Many of her poems deal with themes of death and immortality, two subjects which infused her letters to friends.
Although most of her acquaintances were probably aware of Dickinson's writing, it was not until after her death in 1886â€”when Lavinia, Emily's younger sister, discovered her cache of poemsâ€”that the breadth of Dickinson's work became apparent. Her first collection of poetry was published in 1890 by personal acquaintances Thomas Wentworth Higginson and Mabel Loomis Todd, both of whom heavily edited the content. A complete and mostly unaltered collection of her poetry became available for the first time in 1955 when The Poems of Emily Dickinson was published by scholar Thomas H. Johnson. Despite unfavorable reviews and skepticism of her literary prowess during the late 19th and early 20th century, critics now consider Dickinson to be a major American poet.[3]


Emily Elizabeth Dickinson was born at the family's Homestead in Amherst, Massachusetts on December 10, 1830 into a prominent, but not opulent, family.[4] Two hundred years earlier, the Dickinsons had arrived in the New Worldâ€”in the puritan Great Migrationâ€”where they prospered.[5] Emily Dickinson's paternal grandfather, Samuel Dickinson, had almost single-handedly founded Amherst College.[6] In 1813, he built the Homestead, the large mansion on the town's Main Street that became the focus of Dickinson family life for the better part of a century.[7] Samuel Dickinson's eldest son, Edward, was treasurer of Amherst College for nearly forty years, served numerous terms as a State Legislator, and represented the Hampshire district in the United States Congress. On May 6, 1828, he married Emily Norcross from Monson. They had three children:
By all accounts, young Emily was a well-behaved girl. On an extended visit to Monson when she was two, Emily's Aunt Lavinia described Emily as "perfectly well & contentedâ€”She is a very good child & but little trouble."[9] Emily's aunt also noted the girl's affinity for music and her particular talent for the piano, which she called "the moosic".[10]
Dickinson attended primary school in a two-story building on Pleasant Street.[11] Her education was "ambitiously classical for a Victorian girl".[12] Her father wanted his children well-educated and he followed their progress even while away on business. When Emily was seven, he wrote home reminding his children to "keep school, and learn, so as to tell me, when I come home, how many new things you have learned".[13] While Emily consistently described her father in a warm manner, her correspondence suggests that her mother was regularly cold and aloof. In a letter to a confidante, Emily wrote she "always ran Home to Awe [Austin] when a child, if anything befell me. He was an awful Mother, but I liked him better than none."[14]
On September 7, 1840, Dickinson and her sister Vinnie started together at Amherst Academy, a former boys' school that had opened to female students just two years earlier.[11] At about the same time, her father purchased a house on North Pleasant Street.[15] Emily's brother Austin later described this large new home as the "mansion" over which he and Emily presided as "lord and lady" while their parents were absent.[16] The house overlooked Amherst's burial ground, described by one local minister as treeless and "forbidding".[15]

They shut me up in Prose â€“
As when a little Girl
They put me in the Closet â€“
Because they liked me "still" â€“
Still! Could themself have peeped â€“
And seen my Brain â€“ go round â€“
They might as wise have lodged a Bird
For Treason â€“ in the Pound â€“
Dickinson spent seven years at the Academy, taking classes in English and classical literature, Latin, botany, geology, history, "mental philosophy" and arithmetic.[18] She had a few terms off due to illness: the longest absence was in 1845â€“1846 when she was only enrolled for eleven weeks.[19]
Dickinson was troubled from a young age by the "deepening menace" of death, especially the deaths of those who were close to her. When Sophia Holland, her second cousin and a close friend, grew ill from typhus and died in April 1844, Emily was traumatized.[20] Recalling the incident two years later, Emily wrote that "it seemed to me I should die too if I could not be permitted to watch over her or even look at her face."[21] She became so melancholic that her parents sent her to stay with family in Boston to recover.[22] With her health and spirits restored, she soon returned to Amherst Academy to continue her studies.[23] During this period, she first met people who were to become lifelong friends and correspondents, such as Abiah Root, Abby Wood, Jane Humphrey and Susan Huntington Gilbert (who later married Emily's brother Austin).
In 1845, a religious revival took place in Amherst, resulting in 46 confessions of faith among Dickinson's peers.[24] Dickinson wrote to a friend the following year: "I never enjoyed such perfect peace and happiness as the short time in which I felt I had found my savior."[25] She went on to say that it was her "greatest pleasure to commune alone with the great God & to feel that he would listen to my prayers".[25] The experience did not last: Dickinson never made a formal declaration of faith and attended services regularly for only a few years.[26] After her church-going ended, about 1852, she wrote a poem opening: "Some keep the Sabbath going to Church â€“ / I keep it, staying at Home".[27]
During the last year of her stay at the Academy, Emily became friendly with Leonard Humphrey, its popular new young principal. After finishing her final term at the Academy on August 10, 1847, Dickinson began attending Mary Lyon's Mount Holyoke Female Seminary (which later became Mount Holyoke College) in South Hadley, about ten miles (16 km) from Amherst.[28] She was at the Seminary for only ten months. Although she liked the girls at Holyoke, Dickinson made no lasting friendships there.[29] The explanations for her brief stay at Holyoke differ considerably: either she was in poor health, her father wanted to have her at home, she rebelled against the evangelical fervor present at the school, she disliked the discipline-minded teachers, or she was simply homesick.[30] Whatever the specific reason for leaving Holyoke, her brother Austin appeared on March 25, 1848 to "bring [her] home at all events".[31] Back in Amherst, Dickinson occupied her time with household activities.[32] She took up baking for the family and enjoyed attending local events and activities in the budding college town.[33]

When she was eighteen, Dickinson's family befriended a young attorney by the name of Benjamin Franklin Newton. According to a letter written by Dickinson after Newton's death, he had been "with my Father two years, before going to Worcester â€“ in pursuing his studies, and was much in our family."[34] Although their relationship was probably not romantic, Newton was a formative influence and would become the second in a series of older men (after Humphrey) that Dickinson referred to variously as her tutor, preceptor or master.[35]
Newton likely introduced her to the writings of William Wordsworth, and his gift to her of Ralph Waldo Emerson's first book of collected poems had a liberating effect. She wrote later that he, "whose name my Father's Law Student taught me, has touched the secret Spring".[36] Newton held her in high regard, believing in and recognizing her as a poet. When he was dying of tuberculosis, he wrote to her, saying that he would like to live until she achieved the greatness he foresaw.[36] Biographers believe that Dickinson's statement of 1862â€”"When a little Girl, I had a friend, who taught me Immortality â€“ but venturing too near, himself â€“ he never returned"â€”refers to Newton.[37]
Dickinson was familiar not only with the Bible but also with contemporary popular literature.[38] Dickinson was probably influenced by Lydia Maria Child's Letters from New York, another gift from Newton[20] (after reading it, she enthused "This then is a book! And there are more of them!"[20]). Her brother smuggled a copy of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's Kavanagh into the house for her (because her father might disapprove)[39] and a friend lent her Charlotte BrontÃ«'s Jane Eyre in late 1849.[40] Jane Eyre's influence cannot be measured, but when Dickinson acquired her first and only dog, a Newfoundland, she named him Carlo after the character St. John Rivers' dog.[40] William Shakespeare was a potent influence in her life. Referring to his plays, she wrote to one friend "Why clasp any hand but this?" and to another "Why is any other book needed?"[41]

In early 1850 Dickinson wrote that "Amherst is alive with fun this winter ... Oh, a very great town this is!"[32] Her high spirits soon turned to melancholy after another untimely death. The Amherst Academy principal, Leonard Humphrey, died suddenly of "brain congestion" at age 25.[42] Two years after his death, she revealed to her friend Abiah Root the extent of her depression: "... some of my friends are gone, and some of my friends are sleeping â€“ sleeping the churchyard sleep â€“ the hour of evening is sad â€“ it was once my study hour â€“ my master has gone to rest, and the open leaf of the book, and the scholar at school alone, make the tears come, and I cannot brush them away; I would not if I could, for they are the only tribute I can pay the departed Humphrey".[43]
During the 1850s, Emily's strongest and most affectionate relationship was with Susan Gilbert. Emily eventually sent her over three hundred letters, more than to any other correspondent, over the course of their friendship. Her missives typically dealt with demands for Sue's affection and the fear of unrequited admiration, but because Sue was often aloof and disagreeable, Emily was continually hurt by what was mostly a tempestuous friendship.[44] Sue was nevertheless supportive of the poet, playing the role of "most beloved friend, influence, muse, and adviser whose editorial suggestions Dickinson sometimes followed, Susan played a primary role in Emily's creative processes."[45] Sue married Austin in 1856 after a four-year courtship, although their marriage was not a happy one. Edward Dickinson built a house for him and Sue called the Evergreens, which stood on the west side of the Homestead.[46]
Until 1855, Dickinson had not strayed far from Amherst. That spring, accompanied by her mother and sister, she took one of her longest and farthest trips away from home.[48] First, they spent three weeks in Washington, where her father was representing Massachusetts in Congress. Then they went to Philadelphia for two weeks to visit family. In Philadelphia, she met Charles Wadsworth, a famous minister of the Arch Street Presbyterian Church, with whom she forged a strong friendship which lasted until his death in 1882.[49] Despite only seeing him twice after 1855 (he moved to San Francisco in 1862), she variously referred to him as "my Philadelphia", "my Clergyman", "my dearest earthly friend" and "my Shepherd from 'Little Girl'hood".[50]
From the mid-1850s, Emily's mother became effectively bedridden with various chronic illnesses until her death in 1882.[51] Writing to a friend in summer 1858, Emily said that she would visit if she could leave "home, or mother. I do not go out at all, lest father will come and miss me, or miss some little act, which I might forget, should I run away â€“ Mother is much as usual. I Know not what to hope of her".[52] As her mother continued to decline, Dickinson's domestic responsibilities weighed heavier upon her and she confined herself within the Homestead. Forty years later, Vinnie stated that because their mother was chronically ill, one of the daughters had to remain always with her.[52] Emily took this role as her own, and "finding the life with her books and nature so congenial, continued to live it".[52]
Withdrawing more and more from the outside world, Emily began in the summer of 1858 what would be her lasting legacy. Reviewing poems she had written previously, she began making clean copies of her work, assembling carefully pieced-together manuscript books.[53] The forty fascicles she created from 1858 through 1865 eventually held nearly eight hundred poems.[53] No one was aware of the existence of these books until after her death.
In the late 1850s, the Dickinsons befriended Samuel Bowles, the owner and editor-in-chief of the Springfield Republican, and his wife, Mary.[54] They visited the Dickinsons regularly for years to come. During this time Emily sent him over three dozen letters and nearly fifty poems.[55] Their friendship brought out some of her most intense writing and Bowles published a few of her poems in his journal.[56] It was from 1858 to 1861 that Dickinson is believed to have written a trio of letters that have been called "The Master Letters". These three letters, drafted to an unknown man simply referred to as "Master", continue to be the subject of speculation and contention amongst scholars.[57]
The first half of the 1860s, after she had largely withdrawn from social life,[58] proved to be Dickinson's most productive writing period.[59]

In April 1862, Thomas Wentworth Higginson, a literary critic, radical abolitionist and ex-minister, wrote a lead piece for The Atlantic Monthly entitled "Letter to a Young Contributor". Higginson's essay, in which he urged aspiring writers to "Charge your style with life", contained practical advice for those wishing to break into print.[60] Seeking literary guidance that no one close to her could provide, Dickinson sent him a letter which read in full:[61]
Mr Higginson,
Are you too deeply occupied to say if my Verse is alive?
The Mind is so near itself â€“ it cannot see, distinctly â€“ and I have none to ask â€“
Should you think it breathed â€“ and had you the leisure to tell me, I should feel quick gratitude â€“
If I make the mistake â€“ that you dared to tell me â€“ would give me sincerer honor â€“ toward you â€“
I enclose my name â€“ asking you, if you please â€“ Sir â€“ to tell me what is true?
That you will not betray me â€“ it is needless to ask â€“ since Honor is it's [sic] own pawn â€“
The letter was unsigned, but she had included her name on a card and enclosed it in an envelope along with four of her poems.[62] He praised her work but suggested that she delay publishing until she had written longer, being unaware that she had already appeared in print. She assured him that publishing was as foreign to her "as Firmament to Fin" but also proposed that "If fame belonged to me, I could not escape her".[63]
Dickinson delighted in dramatic self-characterization and mystery in her letters to Higginson.[64] She said of herself: "I am small, like the wren, and my hair is bold, like the chestnut bur, and my eyes like the sherry in the glass that the guest leaves."[65] She stressed her solitary nature, stating that her only real companions were the hills, the sundown and her dog, Carlo. She also mentioned that whereas her mother did not "care for Thought", her father bought her books, but begged her "not to read them â€“ because he fears they joggle the Mind".[66] Dickinson valued his advice, going from calling him "Mr. Higginson" to "Dear friend" as well as signing her letters "Your Gnome" and "Your Scholar".[67] His interest in her work certainly provided great moral support; many years later, Dickinson told Higginson that he had saved her life in 1862.[68] They corresponded until her death.[69]

In direct opposition to the immense productivity that she displayed in the early 1860s, Dickinson wrote fewer poems in 1866.[70] Beset with personal loss as well as loss of domestic help, it is possible that Dickinson was too overcome to keep up her previous level of writing.[71] Carlo died during this time after sixteen years of companionship; Dickinson never owned another dog. Although the household servant of nine years had married and left the Homestead that same year, it was not until 1869 that her family brought in a permanent household servant to replace the old one.[72] Emily once again was responsible for chores, including the baking, at which she excelled.
A solemn thing â€“ it was â€“ I said â€“
A Woman â€“ White â€“ to be â€“
And wear â€“ if God should count me fit â€“
Her blameless mystery â€“
Around this time, Dickinson's behavior began to change. She did not leave the Homestead unless it was absolutely necessary and as early as 1867, she began to talk to visitors from the other side of a door rather than speaking to them face to face.[74] She acquired local notoriety; she was rarely seen and when she was, she was usually clothed in white. Dickinson's one surviving article of clothing is a white cotton dress, possibly sewn circa 1878â€“1882.[75] Few of the locals who exchanged messages with Dickinson during her last fifteen years ever saw her in person.[76] Austin and his family began to protect Emily's privacy, deciding that she was not to be a subject of discussion with outsiders.[77] Despite her physical seclusion, however, Dickinson was socially active and expressive through what makes up two-thirds of her surviving notes and letters. When visitors came to either the Homestead or the Evergreens, she would often leave or send over small gifts of poems or flowers.[78] Dickinson also had a good rapport with the children in her life. Mattie Dickinson, the second child of Austin and Sue, later said that "Aunt Emily stood for indulgence."[79] MacGregor (Mac) Jenkins, the son of family friends who later wrote a short article in 1891 called "A Child's Recollection of Emily Dickinson", thought of her as always offering support to the neighborhood children.[79]
When Higginson urged her to come to Boston in 1868 so that they could formally meet for the first time, she declined, writing: "Could it please your convenience to come so far as Amherst I should be very glad, but I do not cross my Father's ground to any House or town".[80] It was not until he came to Amherst in 1870 that they met. Later he referred to her, in the most detailed and v
