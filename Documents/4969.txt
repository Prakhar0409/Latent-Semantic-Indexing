Heinrich Luitpold Himmler ( listen (helpÂ·info) October 7, 1900 â€“ May 23, 1945) was a Nazi German politician and head of the Schutzstaffel (SS). He was one of most powerful men in Nazi Germany. As ReichsfÃ¼hrer-SS he oversaw all police and security forces, including the Gestapo.
As overseer of concentration camps, extermination camps, and Einsatzgruppen (literally: task forces, often used as killing squads), Himmler coordinated the killing of millions of Jews, between 200,000 and 500,000 Roma,[1][2] many prisoners of war, and possibly another three to four million Poles, communists, or other groups whom the Nazis deemed unworthy to live or simply 'in the way', which included homosexuals and those with physical and mental disabilities. Shortly before the end of the war, he offered to surrender to the Allies if he were spared from prosecution. After being arrested by British forces, he committed suicide before he could be questioned.
Himmler has been named Greatest Mass Murderer of All Time by German news magazine Der Spiegel.[3]


Heinrich Himmler was born in Munich to a Roman Catholic[4] Bavarian middle-class family. His father was Joseph Gebhard Himmler, a secondary-school teacher and principal of the prestigious Wittelsbacher Gymnasium.[5] His mother was Anna Maria Himmler (maiden name Heyder), a devout Roman Catholic and an attentive mother. Heinrich had an older brother, Gebhard Ludwig Himmler, who was born on 29 July 1898, and a younger brother, Ernst Hermann Himmler, born on 23 December 1905.[6]
Heinrich was named after his godfather, Prince Heinrich of Bavaria of the royal family of Bavaria, who was tutored by Gebhard Himmler.[7] In 1910, Himmler attended Gymnasium in Landshut, where he studied classic literature. Himmler's father, the principal, set him as a bully to spy and punish other pupils. His father even called him a born criminal.[8] While he struggled in athletics, he did well in his schoolwork. Also, at the behest of his father, Heinrich kept a diary from age 10 until age 24. He enjoyed chess, harpsichord, stamp collecting, gardening, and other extracurricular activities. Throughout Himmlerâ€™s youth and into adulthood, he was never at ease in interactions with women.[9]
Himmlerâ€™s diaries (1914-1918) show that he was extremely interested in war news. He implored his father to use his royal connections to obtain an officer candidate position for him. His parents eventually gave in, allowing him to train (upon graduation from secondary school in 1918) with the 11th Bavarian Regiment. Since he was not athletic, he struggled throughout his military training. In 1918 the war ended with Germany's defeat, thus ending Himmler's aspirations of becoming a professional army officer.
From 1919 to 1922 Himmler studied agronomy at the Munich Technische Hochschule following a short-lived apprenticeship on a farm and subsequent illness.[10] Himmler was pursuing a chaste lifestyle when he became interested in a young girl who was the daughter of a store owner. In his diary, he compares his initial encounter with her as like finding himself a sister. Later he experienced rejection when he let her know his true feelings. His difficulties with women persisted throughout his life. His feelings towards women are laid bare in a diary excerpt:
A proper man loves a woman on three levels: as a dear child who is to be chided, perhaps even punished on account of her unreasonableness, and who is protected and taken care of because one loves her. Then as wife and as a loyal, understanding comrade who fights through life with one, who stands faithfully at oneâ€™s side without hemming in or chaining the man and his spirit. And as a goddess whose feet one must kiss, who gives one strength through her feminine wisdom and childlike, pure sanctity that does not weaken in the hardest struggles and in the ideal hours gives one heavenly peace.[11]
In his diaries he claimed to be a devout Catholic, and wrote that he would never turn away from the Church. However, he was a member of a fraternity (and later the Thule Society). He felt both associations to be at odds with the tenets of the Church. Biographers have defined Himmlerâ€™s theology as Ariosophy, his own religious dogma of racial superiority of the Aryan race and Germanic Meso-Paganism, developed partly from his interpretations of folklore and mythology of the ancient Teutonic tribes of Northern Europe. During this time he was again obsessed with the idea of becoming a soldier. He wrote that if Germany did not soon go to war, he would go to another country to seek battle.
In 1923, Himmler took part in Hitlerâ€™s Beer Hall Putsch, serving under Ernst RÃ¶hm. In 1926 he met his future wife in a hotel lobby while escaping a storm. Margarete Siegroth (nÃ©e Boden) was blonde-haired and blue-eyed, seven years his senior, divorced, and Protestant. But she was physically the epitome of the Nordic ideal. On 3 July 1928, the two were married. They had their only child, Gudrun, on 8 August, 1929. Himmler adored his daughter, and called her PÃ¼ppi (English: "dolly"). Margarete later adopted a son, in whom Himmler showed no interest. Heinrich and Margarete separated in 1940 without seeking divorce. At that time Himmler became friendly with a secretary, Hedwig Potthast, who left her job in 1941 and became his mistress. He fathered two children with her â€” a son, Helge (born 1942), and a daughter, Nanette Dorothea (born 1944).
Himmler was also very interested in agriculture and the 'back to the land' movement. He and his wife had romantic ideals of making a farming life. He joined the Artamanen society, which was sort of an idealistic back-to-the-land youth group, but mixed with racist ideology.[12] He became one of the leaders of this movement. Through this movement he also apparently met Rudolf HÃ¶ÃŸ,[13] who would later preside over Auschwitz, and Richard Walther DarrÃ©, who would later work in the RuSHA (race and resettlement office) of the SS.[14]


Himmler joined the SS in 1925 and became deputyâ€“ReichsfÃ¼hrer-SS in 1927. Upon the resignation of SS commander Erhard Heiden, Himmler was appointed ReichsfÃ¼hrer-SS in January 1929. The SS then had 280 members and was a mere battalion of the much larger Sturmabteilung (SA).
By 1933, the SS numbered 52,000 members. The organization enforced strict membership requirements ensuring that all members were of Adolf Hitlerâ€™s Aryan Herrenvolk ("Aryan master race"). Himmler and his deputy Reinhard Heydrich, began an effort to separate the SS from SA control. Black SS uniforms replaced the SA brown shirts in the autumn of 1933. Shortly thereafter, Himmler was promoted to SS-ObergruppenfÃ¼hrer and ReichsfÃ¼hrer-SS, thus an equal of the senior SA commanders, who by this time loathed the SS and envied its power.
Himmler, Hermann GÃ¶ring, and General Werner von Blomberg agreed that the SA and its leader Ernst RÃ¶hm posed a threat to the German Army and the Nazi leadership. RÃ¶hm had socialist and populist views, and believed that the real revolution had not yet begun. He felt that the SA should become the sole arms-bearing corps of the state. This left some Nazi leaders believing RÃ¶hm was intent on using the SA to undertake a coup.
Persuaded by Himmler and GÃ¶ring, Hitler agreed that RÃ¶hm had to be eliminated. He delegated this task to Reinhard Heydrich, Kurt Daluege, and Werner Best, who ordered the execution of RÃ¶hm (carried out by Theodor Eicke) and other senior SA officials, plus some of Hitlerâ€™s personal enemies, (like Gregor Strasser and Kurt von Schleicher), on 30 June, 1934, in what became known as the Night of the Long Knives. The next day, the SS became an independent organization.

On 20 April 1934, GÃ¶ring formed a partnership with Himmler and Heydrich. GÃ¶ring transferred authority over the Gestapo (Geheimestaatpolizei), the German secret police to Himmler, who was also named chief of all German police outside Prussia. Himmler on April 22, 1934 named Heydrich the head of the Gestapo.
Two years later, Himmler gained further authority as all of Germanyâ€™s uniformed law enforcement agencies were amalgamated into the new Ordnungspolizei (Orpo: "order police"), whose main office became a headquarters branch of the SS. Himmler also obtained the title Chief of the German Police (Reich S.S. Leader and Chief of German Police within the Reich Ministry of the Interior), after Hitler announced a decree that was to 'unify the control of Police duties in the Reich'. Traditionally, law enforcement in Germany had been a matter of state and local control.
Despite his title, Himmler gained only partial control of the uniformed police. The actual powers granted to him were some that were previously exercised by the ministry of the interior. It was only in 1943, when Himmler was appointed minister of the interior, that the transfer of ministerial power was complete.
Himmler also oversaw the entire concentration camp system. Once war began, though, new internment camps, which were not formally classified as concentration camps, were established, over which Himmler and the SS did not exercise control. In 1943, following the outbreak of popular word-of-mouth criticism of the regime as a result of the Stalingrad disaster, the party apparatus, professing disappointment with the Gestapoâ€™s performance in deterring such criticism, established the Politische Staffeln (political squads) as its own political policing organ, destroying the Gestapoâ€™s monopoly in this field.
With his 1936 appointment, Himmler also gained ministerial authority over Germanyâ€™s non-political detective forces, the Kriminalpolizei (Kripo: crime police), which he attempted to combine with the Gestapo into the Sicherheitspolizei (Sipo: security police) under the command of Reinhard Heydrich, and thus gain operational control over Germanyâ€™s entire detective force. This merger was never complete within the Reich, with Kripo remaining mainly under the control of its own civilian administration and later the party apparatus as the latter annexed the civilian administration. However, in occupied territories not incorporated into the Reich proper, Sipo consolidation within the SS line of command proved mostly effective. Following the outbreak of World War II, Himmler formed the Reichssicherheitshauptamt (RSHA: Reich Main Security Office) wherein the Gestapo, Kripo and Sicherheitsdienst (SD: security services) became departments under Heydrich's command.
The SS during these years developed its own military branch, the SS-VerfÃ¼gungstruppe, which later became the Waffen-SS. Even though nominally under the authority of Himmler, the Waffen-SS developed a fully militarized structure of command and operationally were incorporated in the war effort parallel to the Wehrmacht. Many contemporary commentators refuse to recognize the Waffen SS as in any sense an honorable military organisation. Its units were involved in many notorious incidents of murdering civilians and unarmed prisoners. For this reason, postwar war crimes tribunals declared the Waffen SS to be a criminal organization.
