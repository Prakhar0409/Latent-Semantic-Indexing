Adele debuted at number one with her Mercury Prize-nominated debut album 19 on the UK album chart; the album has since been certified platinum with sales of more than 500,000 copies in the UK and over 1,200,000 worldwide.[6] After the album peaked at #54 on the Billboard 200 chart on 8 July, 2008 (and #36 on the magazine's "Top Heatseekers" chart)[7] Adele performed before more than 17 million television viewers on Saturday Night Live, leading to a very strong showing on a couple of notable download charts, and leading the album to leap from #46 to #11 on the official chart.

Adele began singing at age 4,[10] when she became obsessed with voices, an obsession that is ongoing.[11] Adele impersonated the Spice Girls at dinner parties. As a preteen she sang Destiny's Child songs at her mostly black school.[12] To make her look like the singer, her mother made an eye patch with sequins, which she said was embarrassing.[13] Adele went through a phase where she wore Slipknot clothing and a studded dog collar.[14] Adele then claimed she was influenced by the music of Etta James and Ella Fitzgerald in her teens by accident, as she stumbled on the artists' CDs on a local HMV store while looking for a new hairstyle. She only got to listen to those songs for the first time as she was clearing her room.[15] She graduated from BRIT School in Croydon in May 2006, which was the same performing arts school attended by Amy Winehouse, Katie Melua, Leona Lewis, Imogen Heap and Kate Nash.[15][16] Adele credits the school with nurturing her talent.[5] A month later, she published two songs on the fourth issue of the online arts publication PlatformsMagazine.com.[17] Since then Adele has played in small UK gigs, and has toured with best friend Jack Pe√±ate, as well as Jamie T, Raul Midon, Devendra Banhart, Amos Lee, Keren Ann and the band Exist.
