Cloverfield
Cloverfield is a 2008 monster movie directed by Matt Reeves, produced by J. J. Abrams and written by Drew Goddard.
Before the film's release Paramount Pictures carried out a viral marketing campaign to promote the film. The campaign included viral tie-ins similar to Lost Experience.[5] The film follows five young New Yorkers attending a going-away party on the night that a gigantic monster attacks the city. First publicized within a teaser trailer in screenings of Transformers, the film was released on January 17 in New Zealand and Australia, on January 18 in North America, on January 24 in South Korea and on February 1 in Ireland, in the UK and in Italy. In Japan, the film was released on April 5. This film has been nominated for a UL Media Award for "Best Dramatic Film."
VFX and CGI were performed by effects studios Double Negative and Tippett Studio. The film has grossed $30,341,830 in DVD sales, bringing its total film gross to over 100 million dollars. [6]

The film is presented as if it were a video file recovered from a digital camcorder by the United States Department of Defense. The film begins with a disclaimer stating that the following footage is of a case designated "Cloverfield" and was found in the area "formerly known as Central Park".
Robert "Rob" Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David) wakes up in the morning on April 27 after sleeping with a previously platonic best friend, Elizabeth "Beth" McIntyre (Odette Yustman). They plan to leave for Coney Island that day. The footage overlaps, cutting to the next month, when Rob's brother Jason (Mike Vogel) and his girlfriend Lily (Jessica Lucas) prepare a farewell party for Rob as he is about to leave for his job in Japan. While the party goes on, Jason gives their friend Hudson "Hud" Platt (T.J. Miller) the task of filming last testimonials for Rob, but while filming the party and his unsuccessful flirting with his crush Marlena Diamond (Lizzy Caplan), Hud also accidentally tapes over Rob and Beth's Coney Island trip.
During the party, the building shakes and suffers a brief power outage. The local news reports that an oil tanker had capsized in the bay off Lower Manhattan. Party guests go to the roof to spot the disaster and witness a huge explosion at Lower Manhattan which sends burning debris into the air which starts to land on the roof they are standing on. The party-goers run down the fire escape and onto the street, which is filled with panicked city-dwellers, where the head of the Statue of Liberty suddenly appears bouncing down the road before crashing to rest near their building. Hud records what appears to be a giant monster between the buildings several blocks away before everyone is forced to take shelter in a convenience store when the Woolworth Building collapses.
When they get out, Jason tells everyone that they have to leave Manhattan, choosing the Brooklyn Bridge as an escape route. As they cross the span, Rob gets a call on his cellphone from Beth and stops moving. Hud, Lily, and Marlena stop as well, but Jason cannot hear them and keeps going. Suddenly, the monster crushes the main span of the bridge, causing it to collapse and killing Jason and hundreds of others. The survivors are forced to flee back into Manhattan.
Marlena and Hud try to comfort Rob and Lily over the loss of Jason. Rob attempts to use his phone again, but discovers the battery has gone dead. He stops at an electronics store that is being looted and steals a cell phone battery to listen to Beth's message, she is trapped and unable to move. On the news, Hud sees that the military is attacked by parasitic spider-like creatures that are falling off of the monster. After an argument, Rob, Hud, Lily, and Marlena take to the Manhattan streets to rescue Beth.
They are soon caught in a crossfire between the Cloverfield Monster and the United States Military. The group barely manages to escape into the subway. They decide to go through the subway tunnels to reach Beth's apartment, but are attacked by several parasites. One of them bites Marlena as she tries to rescue Hud. The group escapes into the abandoned Bloomingdale's department store via the 59th Street subway station, and are engaged by Sergeant Pryce and a squad of infantry, who have taken cover inside the store and set up a field hospital and command center to treat the wounded. Marlena begins to bleed from her eyes and nose. When she is revealed to have been bitten, two men in hazmat suits grab her and take her behind a curtain while Lily, Rob and Hud are taken away by soldiers. Hud films the curtains and sees Marlena's stomach expand and explode. Rob and the others have little time to grieve as Sergeant Pryce allows them back up to the streets, but warns them to report to a military evacuation site before 6:00 am, which is when the last helicopter evacuates Manhattan and the military will enact its "Hammerdown" protocol, which will allow the sacrifice of the island if necessary to kill the monster.
The group finds Beth's apartment tower at Time Warner Center has collapsed against the center's other tower. They climb the standing tower and cross onto the roof of Beth's building and work their way down to her apartment. Beth is found trapped and impaled by a concrete rebar, but they are able to free her. After the rescue, the four make their way to an aerial evacuation site where they encounter the monster once more, while the military continues to engage it. At the landing zone, Lily is raced into a departing helicopter without her friends. Moments later, Rob, Beth and Hud are taken away in a second helicopter and witness a Stealth Bomber releasing a huge payload of bombs on the Cloverfield Monster. Just as Hud begins hailing victory over the monster, it reaches up and attacks the helicopter, causing it to crash into a grassy clearing in Central Park. A voice on the helicopter's radio warns of the Hammerdown protocol being effective in fifteen minutes.
Hud and Beth pull an injured Rob clear of the helicopter wreckage, but Hud returns to recover the camera and as he does, the monster appears above him. This is the first time the monster is seen clearly, in daylight.[7] It curiously examines Hud for a moment, then attempts to eat him, spitting out his legless corpse afterwards. Rob and Beth grab the still-recording camera and take shelter under a bridge in Central Park as air raid sirens begin to blare in the distance, indicating that the "Hammerdown" protocol is about to begin. Rob and Beth quickly take turns leaving their last testimonies of the day, which Rob mentions as Saturday, May 23, on camera. Numerous explosions occur outside and the monster can be heard roaring in pain in the distance. As the bridge collapses and debris covers the camera, Rob and Beth can be heard professing their love to one another before another explosion occurs. The film cuts to Rob and Beth's Coney Island date many days before they meet again at the start of the party. In the background, a large object can be seen falling from the sky and landing in the ocean.
After the credits roll, a sound clip can be heard. When played backwards, the audio says, "It's still alive".[citation needed]

To prevent the leaking of plot information, instead of auditioning the actors with scenes from the film, scripts from Abrams' previous productions were used, such as television series Alias and Lost. Some scenes were also written specifically for the audition process, not intended for use in the film. Despite not being told the premise of the film, Lizzy Caplan stated that she accepted a role in Cloverfield solely because she was a fan of the Abrams-produced television series Lost, and her experience of discovering its true nature initially caused her to state that she would not sign on for a film in the future "without knowing full well what it is". She indicated that her character was a sarcastic outsider, and that her role was "physically demanding".[8]


J. J. Abrams conceived of a new monster after he and his son visited a toy store in Japan while promoting Mission: Impossible III. He explained, "We saw all these Godzilla toys, and I thought, we need our own [American] monster, and not like King Kong. I love King Kong. King Kong is adorable. And Godzilla is a charming monster. We love Godzilla. But I wanted something that was just insane, and intense."[9][10] Abrams pays homage to King Kong approximately 67 minutes into the movie, just after the helicopter crashes. When the video of the camera breaks up, a quick scene from Coney Island is seen. This is followed by several still frames from the original King Kong movie. There are two other still frames in "pre-recorded" sequences, one from the movie Them! and one from The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms - these two movies are also cited in the credits.
In February 2007, Paramount Pictures secretly greenlit Cloverfield, to be produced by Abrams, directed by Matt Reeves and written by Drew Goddard. The project was produced by Abrams' company, Bad Robot Productions.[11] The visual effects producer was Chantal Feghali.
The severed head of the Statue of Liberty was inspired by the poster of the 1981 film Escape from New York, which had shown the head lying in the streets in New York. According to Reeves, "It's an incredibly provocative image. And that was the source that inspired producer J. J. Abrams to say, 'Now this would be an interesting idea for a movie'."[12]
The film was titled Cloverfield from the beginning, but the title changed throughout production before it was finalized as the original title. Matt Reeves explained that the title was changed frequently due to the hype caused by the teaser trailer, "That excitement spread to such a degree that we suddenly couldn't use the name anymore. So we started using all these names like Slusho and Cheese.[13] And people always found out what we were doing!" The director said that "Cloverfield" was the government's case designation for the events caused by the monster, comparing the titling to that of the Manhattan Project. "And it's not a project per se. It's the way that this case has been designated. That's why that is on the trailer, and it becomes clearer in the film. It's how they refer to this phenomenon [or] this case", said the director.[14] The film's final title, Cloverfield, is the name of the exit Abrams takes to his Santa Monica office.[13][15]
One final title, Greyshot, was proposed before the movie was officially titled Cloverfield. The name Greyshot is taken from the archway that the two survivors take shelter under at the end of the movie. Director Matt Reeves said that it was decided not to change the title to Greyshot because the film was already so well known as Cloverfield.[16]

The casting process was carried out in secret, with no script being sent out to candidates. With production estimated to have a budget of $30†million, filming began in mid-June 2007 in New York.[11] One cast member indicated that the film would look like it cost $150†million, despite producers not casting recognizable and expensive actors.[8] Filmmakers used the Sony CineAlta F23 high-definition video camera to film nearly all of the New York exterior scenes.[17] Filming took place on Coney Island, with scenes shot at Deno's Wonder Wheel Amusement Park and the B&B Carousel.[18] Some interior shots were filmed on a soundstage at Downey, California, Bloomingdale's in the movie was actually filmed in an emptied Robinsons-May store that was under reconstruction in Arcadia, California, and the outside scenes of Sephora and the electronics store were filmed in Downtown Los Angeles.[19]
The film was shot and edited in a cin√©ma v√©rit√© style,[20] to look like it was filmed with one hand-held camera, including jump cuts similar to ones found in home movies. T. J. Miller, who plays Hud, has said in various interviews that he filmed a third of the movie and almost half of it made it into the film.[21] Director Matt Reeves described the presentation, "We wanted this to be as if someone found a Handicam, took out the tape and put it in the player to watch it. What you're watching is a home movie that then turns into something else." Reeves explained that the pedestrians documenting the severed head of the Statue of Liberty with the camera phones was reflective of the contemporary period. According to him: "Cloverfield very much speaks to the fear and anxieties of our time, how we live our lives. Constantly documenting things and putting them up on YouTube, sending people videos through e-mail ‚Äì we felt it was very applicable to the way people feel now."[22]
Several of the filmmakers are heard but not seen in the film. The man yelling "Oh my God!" repeatedly when the head of the Statue of Liberty lands in the street is producer Bryan Burk, and director Matt Reeves voiced the whispered radio broadcast at the end of the credits.[16]
After viewing a cut of the film, Steven Spielberg suggested giving the audience a hint at the fate of the monster during the climax, which resulted in the addition of a countdown overheard on the helicopter's radio and the sounding of air raid sirens to signal the forthcoming Hammerdown bombing.[16]

Visual main effects supervisor Phil Tippett and his company Tippett Studio were enlisted to develop the visual effects for Cloverfield.[23] Because the visual effects were incorporated after filming, cast members had to react to a non-existent creature during scenes, only being familiar with early conceptual renderings of the beast.[24] Artist Neville Page designed the monster, thoroughly creating a biological rationale for the creature, even if many of his ideas like "elongated, and articulated external esophagus" would not show up on screen.[25] The key idea behind the monster was that he was an immature creature suffering from "separation anxiety". This recalls real-life elephants who get frightened and lash out at the circus, because the director felt "there's nothing scarier than something huge that's spooked".[26]

Filmmakers decided to create a teaser trailer that would be a surprise in the light of commonplace media saturation, which they put together during the preparation stage of the production process. The teaser was then used as a basis for the film itself. Paramount Pictures encouraged the teaser to be released without a title attached, and the Motion Picture Association of America approved the move.[22] As Transformers showed high tracking numbers before its release in July 2007, the studio attached the teaser trailer for Cloverfield that showed the release date of January 18, 2008 but not the title.[11] A second trailer was released on November 16, 2007 which was attached to Beowulf, confirming the title.[27]
The studio had kept knowledge of the project secret from the online community, a cited rarity due to the presence of scoopers that follow upcoming films. The controlled release of information on the film has been observed as a risky strategy, which could succeed like The Blair Witch Project (1999) or disappoint like Snakes on a Plane (2006), the latter of which had generated online hype but failed to attract large audiences. Chad Hartigan of Exhibitor Relations Co. saw several issues with the potential of the film, including a lack of major stars, the underwhelming performance of Godzilla-style films in America, and the film's slated release in January, considered a "dumping ground for bad films".[28]

The sudden appearance of the untitled trailer for Cloverfield fueled media speculation over the film's plot. USA Today reported the possibilities of the film being based on the works of H. P. Lovecraft, a live-action adaptation of Voltron (based on a mis-interpretation of the trailer's line "It's alive!" as "It's a lion!"), a new film about Godzilla, or a spin-off of the TV show Lost.[29] The Star Ledger also reported the possibility of the film being based on Lovecraft lore or Godzilla.[30] The Guardian reported the possibility of a Lost spin-off,[31] while Time Out reported that the film was about an alien called "The Parasite".[32] IGN also backed the possibility of that premise, with The Parasite rumored to be a working title for the film.[14] Online, Slusho and Colossus had been discussed as other possible titles.[33] Entertainment Weekly also disputed reports that the film would be about a parasite or a colossal Asian robot such as Voltron.[34]
Visitors of the website Ain't It Cool News have pointed out 9/11 allusions based on the destruction in New York City such as the decapitated Statue of Liberty. The film has also drawn alternate reality game enthusiasts that have followed other viral marketing campaigns like those set up for the TV series Lost, the video game Halo 2, the Nine Inch Nails album Year Zero, and the newest Batman film The Dark Knight. Members of the forums at argn.com and unfiction.com have investigated the background of the film, with the "1-18-08" section at Unfiction generating over 7,700 posts in August 2007. The members have studied photographs on the film's official site, potentially related MySpace profiles,[35] and the Comic-Con teaser poster for the film.[28] A popular piece of fan art posited that the monster was a mutated Humpback Whale.[26]
