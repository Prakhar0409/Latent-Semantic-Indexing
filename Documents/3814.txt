Israel
Israel (Hebrew: ×™Ö´×©Ö°×‚×¨Ö¸×Öµ×œâ€, Yisra'el; Arabic: Ø¥ÙØ³Ù’Ø±ÙØ§Ø¦ÙÙŠÙ„Ùâ€, IsrÄ'Ä«l) officially the State of Israel ( ×Ö°×“Ö´×™× Ö·×ª ×™Ö´×©Ö°×‚×¨Ö¸×Öµ×œ (helpÂ·info), Medinat Yisra'el; Arabic: Ø¯ÙÙˆÙ’Ù„ÙØ©Ù Ø¥ÙØ³Ù’Ø±ÙØ§Ø¦ÙÙŠÙ„Ùâ€, Dawlat IsrÄ'Ä«l), is a country in the Middle East located on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea. It borders Lebanon in the north, Syria in the northeast, Jordan in the east, and Egypt on the southwest, and contains geographically diverse features within its relatively small area.[5] Also adjacent are the West Bank to the east and Gaza Strip to the southwest. Israel is the world's only predominantly Jewish state[6] with a population of about 7.37 million people, of which approximately 5.57 million belong to the majority Jewish ethnoreligious group.[3][7] The largest ethnic minority group is the segment denominated as Arab citizens of Israel, while minority religious groups include Muslims, Christians, Druze, Samaritans and others, most of which are found within the Arab segment.
The modern state of Israel has its religious roots in the Biblical Land of Israel (Eretz Yisrael), a concept central to Judaism since ancient times,[8][9] and the heartland of the ancient kingdoms of Israel and Judah.[10] Following the birth of political Zionism in 1897 and its acceptance by the British Balfour Declaration, the League of Nations adopted the British Mandate of Palestine after World War I, which was "in favor of the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, it being clearly understood that nothing should be done which might prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine..."[11] In November 1947 the United Nations voted for the partition of Palestine into two states, one Jewish and one Arab.[12] The partition plan was accepted by Zionist leaders and rejected by Arab leaders; the 1947â€“1948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine immediately followed that decision. On May 14, 1948, with the British mandate ending, Zionists declared Israel independent; the neighboring Arab states invaded the next day. Israel was subsequently victorious in confirming its independence; as a result of the war, the new Jewish state gained control of areas beyond those in the UN Partition Plan. Israel has since fought a series of wars with neighboring Arab states,[13] and in consequence, Israel controls territories beyond those delineated in the 1949 Armistice Agreementsand many boundaries remain in dispute. Israel has signed peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan, though efforts to resolve conflict with the Palestinians have so far only met with limited success.
Israel is a representative democracy with a parliamentary system and universal suffrage.[14][15] The Prime Minister serves as head of government and the Knesset serves as Israel's legislative body. In terms of nominal gross domestic product, the nation's economy is estimated as being the 44th-largest in the world.[16] Israel ranks highest among Middle Eastern countries on the bases of human development,[17] freedom of the press,[18][19] and economic competitiveness.[20] Jerusalem is the country's capital, seat of government, and largest city, while Israel's main financial center is Tel Aviv.[1]

Over the past three thousand years, the name "Israel" has meant in common and religious usage both the Land of Israel and the entire Jewish nation.[21] According to the Bible, Jacob is renamed Israel after successfully wrestling with an angel of God.[22]
The earliest archaeological artifact to mention "Israel" (other than as a personal name) is the Merneptah Stele of ancient Egypt (dated the late 13th century BCE) where it refers to the people of the land.[23] The modern country was named Medinat Yisrael, or the State of Israel, after other proposed names, including Eretz Israel ("the Land of Israel"), Zion, and Judea, were rejected.[24] In the early weeks of independence, the government chose the term "Israeli" to denote a citizen of Israel, with the formal announcement made by Minister of Foreign Affairs Moshe Sharett.[25]


The Land of Israel, known in Hebrew as Eretz Yisrael, has been sacred to the Jewish people since Biblical times. According to the Torah, the Land of Israel was promised to the three Patriarchs of the Jewish people, by God, as their homeland;[26][27] scholars have placed this period in the early 2nd millennium BCE.[28] According to the traditional view, around the 11th century BCE, the first of a series of Israelite kingdoms and states established rule over the region; these Israelite kingdoms and states ruled intermittently for the following one thousand years.[29] The sites holiest to Judaism are located within Israel.
Between the time of the Israelite kingdoms and the 7th-century Muslim conquests, the Land of Israel fell under Assyrian, Babylonian, Persian, Greek, Roman, Sassanian, and Byzantine rule.[30] Jewish presence in the region dwindled after the failure of the Bar Kokhba revolt against the Roman Empire in 132 CE and the resultant large-scale expulsion of Jews. In 628/9, the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius conducted a massacre and expulsion of the Jews, at which point the Jewish population probably reached its lowest point. Nevertheless, a continuous Jewish presence in the Land of Israel remained. Although the main Jewish population shifted from the Judea region to the Galilee,[31] the Mishnah and part of the Talmud, among Judaism's most important religious texts, were composed in Israel during this period.[32] The Land of Israel was captured from the Byzantine Empire around 636 CE during the initial Muslim conquests. Control of the region transferred between the Umayyads,[33] Abbasids,[34] and Crusaders over the next six centuries, before falling in the hands of the Mamluk Sultanate, in 1260. In 1516, the Land of Israel became a part of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled the region until the 20th century.[35]
