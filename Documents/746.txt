Pritzker Prize
The Pritzker Architecture Prize is awarded annually by the Hyatt Foundation to honor "a living architect whose built work demonstrates a combination of those qualities of talent, vision and commitment, which has produced consistent and significant contributions to humanity and the built environment through the art of architecture."[1]
Created in 1979 by Jay A. Pritzker and run by the Pritzker family, it is one of the world's premier architecture prizes. The prize is awarded "irrespective of nationality, race, creed, or ideology."[2]
Part of the criteria in this prize is the innovative quality and fineness of architectural thought given to accomplish such architectural work. Contributions to the integration of good use of construction technology is also a factor.
The winner receives US$100,000, but more important is the industry-wide fame and subsequent interest from building developers. The Pritzker is sometimes referred to as "the Nobel Prize of Architecture."[3][4][5]
