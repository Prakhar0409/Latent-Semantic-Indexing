Omega-3 fatty acid
nâˆ’3 fatty acids (popularly referred to as Ï‰âˆ’3 fatty acids or omega-3 fatty acids) are a family of unsaturated fatty acids that have in common a final carbonâ€“carbon double bond in the nâˆ’3 position; that is, the third bond from the methyl end of the fatty acid.
Important nutritionally-essential nâˆ’3 fatty acids are: Î±-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), all of which are polyunsaturated. The human body cannot synthesize nâˆ’3 fatty acids de novo, but it can form 20- and 22-carbon unsaturated nâˆ’3 fatty acids from the eighteen-carbon nâˆ’3 fatty acid, Î±-linolenic acid. These conversions occur competitively with nâˆ’6 fatty acids, which are essential closely related chemical analogues that are derived from linoleic acid. Both the nâˆ’3 Î±-linolenic acid and nâˆ’6 linoleic acid are essential nutrients which must be obtained from food. Synthesis of the longer nâˆ’3 fatty acids from linolenic acid within the body is competitively slowed by the nâˆ’6 analogues. Thus accumulation of long-chain nâˆ’3 fatty acids in tissues is more effective when they are obtained directly from food or when competing amounts of nâˆ’6 analogs do not greatly exceed the amounts of nâˆ’3.[citation needed]

The term nâˆ’3 (also called Ï‰âˆ’3 or omega-3) signifies that the first double bond exists as the third carbon-carbon bond from the terminal methyl end (n) of the carbon chain.
nâˆ’3 fatty acids which are important in human nutrition are: Î±-linolenic acid (18:3, nâˆ’3; ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5, nâˆ’3; EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6, nâˆ’3; DHA). These three polyunsaturates have either 3, 5 or 6 double bonds in a carbon chain of 18, 20 or 22 carbon atoms, respectively. All double bonds are in the cis-configuration, i.e. the two hydrogen atoms are on the same side of the double bond.
Most naturally-produced fatty acids (created or transformed in animalia or plant cells with an even number of carbon in chains) are in cis-configuration where they are more easily transformable. The trans-configuration results in much more stable chains that are very difficult to further break or transform, forming longer chains that aggregate in tissues and lacking the necessary hydrophilic properties. This trans-configuration can be the result of the transformation in alkaline solutions, or of the action of some bacterias that are shortening the carbonic chains. Natural transforms in vegetal or animal cells more rarely affect the last nâˆ’3 group itself. However, nâˆ’3 compounds are still more fragile than nâˆ’6 because the last double bond is geometrically and electrically more exposed, notably in the natural cis configuration.

This table lists several different names for the most common nâˆ’3 fatty acids found in nature.

A 1992 article by biochemist William E.M. Lands[1] provides an overview of the research into nâˆ’3 fatty acids, and is the basis of this section.
The 'essential' fatty acids were given their name when researchers found that they were essential to normal growth in young children and animals. (Note that the modern definition of 'essential' is more strict.) A small amount of nâˆ’3 in the diet (~1% of total calories) enabled normal growth, and increasing the amount had little to no additional effect on growth.
Likewise, researchers found that nâˆ’6 fatty acids (such as Î³-linolenic acid and arachidonic acid) play a similar role in normal growth. However, they also found that nâˆ’6 was "better" at supporting dermal integrity, renal function, and parturition. These preliminary findings led researchers to concentrate their studies on nâˆ’6, and it was only in recent decades that nâˆ’3 has become of interest.
In 1963 it was discovered that the nâˆ’6 arachidonic acid was converted by the body into pro-inflammatory agents called prostaglandins. By 1979 more of what are now known as eicosanoids were discovered: thromboxanes, prostacyclins and the leukotrienes. The eicosanoids, which have important biological functions, typically have a short active lifetime in the body, starting with synthesis from fatty acids and ending with metabolism by enzymes. However, if the rate of synthesis exceeds the rate of metabolism, the excess eicosanoids may have deleterious effects. Researchers found that nâˆ’3 is also converted into eicosanoids, but at a much slower rate. Eicosanoids made from nâˆ’3 fats often have opposing functions to those made from nâˆ’6 fats (ie, anti-inflammatory rather than inflammatory). If both nâˆ’3 and nâˆ’6 are present, they will "compete" to be transformed, so the ratio of nâˆ’3:nâˆ’6 directly affects the type of eicosanoids that are produced.
This competition was recognized as important when it was found that thromboxane is a factor in the clumping of platelets, which leads to thrombosis. The leukotrienes were similarly found to be important in immune/inflammatory-system response, and therefore relevant to arthritis, lupus, and asthma. These discoveries led to greater interest in finding ways to control the synthesis of nâˆ’6 eicosanoids. The simplest way would be by consuming more nâˆ’3 and fewer nâˆ’6 fatty acids.

On September 8, 2004, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave "qualified health claim" status to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) nâˆ’3 fatty acids, stating that "supportive but not conclusive research shows that consumption of EPA and DHA [nâˆ’3] fatty acids may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease."[2] This updated and modified their health risk advice letter of 2001 (see below). Currently regulatory agencies do not accept that there is sufficient evidence for any of the other suggested benefits of DHA and EPA other than for cardiovascular health, and further claims should be treated with caution.
Note that taking the 18 carbon Î±-linolenic acid has not been shown to have the same cardiovascular benefits as DHA or EPA. Currently there are many products on the market which claim to contain health promoting 'omega 3', but contain only Î±-linolenic acid (ALA), not EPA or DHA. These products contain mainly higher plant oils and must be converted by the body to create DHA and therefore considered less efficient. DHA and EPA are made by microalgae that live in seawater. These are then consumed by fish and accumulate to high levels in their internal organs. People with certain circulatory problems, such as varicose veins, benefit from fish oil because it contains the EPA and DHA derived from microalgae. Fish oil stimulates blood circulation, increases the breakdown of fibrin, a compound involved in clot and scar formation, and additionally has been shown to reduce blood pressure.[3][4] There is strong scientific evidence that nâˆ’3 fatty acids reduce blood triglyceride levels[5][6][7][8] and regular intake reduces the risk of secondary and primary heart attack.[9][10][11][12]

Some benefits have been reported in conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis[13][14] and cardiac arrhythmias.[15][16][17]

There is preliminary evidence that n-3 fatty acids supplementation might be helpful in cases of depression[18][19] and anxiety.[20][21] Studies report highly significant improvement from n-3 fatty acids supplementation alone and in conjunction with medication.[22]
Some research suggests that fish oil intake may reduce the risk of ischemic and thrombotic stroke.[23][24][25] However, very large amounts may actually increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke (see below). Lower amounts are not related to this risk,[25] 3 grams of total EPA/DHA daily are considered safe with no increased risk of bleeding involved[26] and many studies used substantially higher doses without major side effects (for example: 4.4 grams EPA/2.2 grams DHA in 2003 study).[18]

Several studies report possible anti-cancer effects of nâˆ’3 fatty acids (particularly breast, colon and prostate cancer).[27][28][29] Omega-3 fatty acids reduced prostate tumor growth, slowed histopathological progression, and increased survival[30]. Among n-3 fatty acids [omega-3], neither long-chain nor short-chain forms were consistently associated with breast cancer risk. High levels of docosahexaenoic acid, however, the most abundant n-3 PUFA [omega-3] in erythrocyte membranes, were associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer.[31].
A 2006 report in the Journal of the American Medical Association concluded that their review of literature covering cohorts from many countries with a wide variety of demographic concluded that there was no link between nâˆ’3 fatty acids and cancer.[32] This is similar to the findings of a review by the British Medical Journal of studies up to February 2002 that failed to find clear effects of long and shorter chain nâˆ’3 fats on total mortality, combined cardiovascular events and cancer.[33]

In 1999, the GISSI-Prevenzione Investigators reported in the Lancet, the results of major clinical study in 11,324 patients with a recent myocardial infarction. Treatment 1 gram per day of nâˆ’3 fatty acids reduced the occurrence of death, cardiovascular death and sudden cardiac death by 20%, 30% and 45% respectively.[34] These beneficial effects were seen already from three months onwards.[35]
In April 2006, a team led by Lee Hooper at the University of East Anglia in Norwich, UK, published a review of almost 100 separate studies into nâˆ’3 fatty acids, found in abundance in oily fish. It concluded that they do not have a significant protective effect against cardiovascular disease.[36] This meta-analysis was controversial and stands in stark contrast with two different reviews also performed in 2006 by the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition[37] and a second JAMA review[38] that both indicated decreases in total mortality and cardiovascular incidents (i.e. myocardial infarctions) associated with the regular consumption of fish and fish oil supplements. In addition nâˆ’3 has been shown to reduce symptoms of other mental disorders such as aggression and ADHD.[39][40]
Several studies published in 2007 have been more positive. In the March 2007 edition of the journal Atherosclerosis, 81 Japanese men with unhealthy blood sugar levels were randomly assigned to receive 1800 mg daily of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA â€” an nâˆ’3 essential fatty acid from fish oil) with the other half being a control group. The thickness of the carotid arteries and certain measures of blood flow were measured before and after supplementation. This went on for approximately two years. A total of 60 patients (30 in the EPA group and 30 in the control group) completed the study. Those given the EPA had a statistically significant decrease in the thickness of the carotid arteries along with improvement in blood flow. The authors indicated that this was the first demonstration that administration of purified EPA improves the thickness of carotid arteries along with improving blood flow in patients with unhealthy blood sugar levels.[41]
In another study published in the American Journal of Health System Pharmacy March 2007, patients with high triglycerides and poor coronary artery health were given 4 grams a day of a combination of EPA and DHA along with some monounsaturated fatty acids. Those patients with very unhealthy triglyceride levels (above 500 mg/dl) reduced their triglycerides on average 45% and their VLDL cholesterol by more than 50%. VLDL is a bad type of cholesterol and elevated triglycerides can also be deleterious for cardiovascular health.[42]
There was another study published on the benefits of EPA in The Lancet in March 2007. This study involved over 18,000 patients with unhealthy cholesterol levels. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either 1,800 mg a day of EPA with a statin drug or a statin drug alone. The trial went on for a total of five years. It was found at the end of the study those patients in the EPA group had superior cardiovascular function. Non-fatal coronary events were also significantly reduced in the EPA group. The authors concluded that EPA is a promising treatment for prevention of major coronary events, especially non-fatal coronary events.[43]
Similar to those who follow a Mediterranean diet, Arctic-dwelling Inuit - who consume high amounts of nâˆ’3 fatty acids from fatty fish - also tend to have higher proportions of nâˆ’3, increased HDL cholesterol and decreased triglycerides (fatty material that circulates in the blood) and less heart disease. Eating walnuts (the ratio of nâˆ’3 to nâˆ’6 is circa 1:4 respectively[44]) was reported to lower total cholesterol by 4% relative to controls when people also ate 27% less cholesterol.[45]

A study carried out involving 465 women showed serum levels of eicosapentaenoic acid is inversely related to the levels of anti-oxidized-LDL antibodies. Oxidative modification of LDL is thought to play an important role in the development of atherosclerosis.[46]

Another study regarding fish oil was published in the Journal of Nutrition in April 2007. Sixty four healthy Danish infants from nine to twelve months of age received either cow's milk or infant formula alone or with fish oil. It was found that those infants supplemented with fish oil had improvement in immune function maturation with no apparent reduction in immune activation.[47]

There was yet another study on nâˆ’3 fatty acids published in the April 2007 Journal of Neuroscience. A group of mice were genetically modified to develop accumulation of amyloid and tau proteins in the brain similar to that seen in people with poor memory. The mice were divided into four groups with one group receiving a typical American diet (with high ratio of nâˆ’6 to nâˆ’3 fatty acids being 10 to 1). The other three groups were given food with a balanced 1 to 1 nâˆ’6 to nâˆ’3 ratio and two additional groups supplemented with DHA plus long chain nâˆ’6 fatty acids. After three months of feeding, all the DHA supplemented groups were noted to have a lower accumulation of beta amyloid and tau protein. Some research suggests that these abnormal proteins may contribute to the development of memory loss in later years.[48]
There is also a study published regarding nâˆ’3 supplementation in children with learning and behavioral problems. This study was published in the April 2007 edition of the Journal of the Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics (5), where 132 children, between the ages of seven to twelve years old, with poor learning, participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded interventional trial. A total of 104 children completed the trial. For the first fifteen weeks of this study, the children were given polyunsaturated fatty acids (nâˆ’3 and nâˆ’6, 3000 mg a day), polyunsaturated fatty acids plus multi-vitamins and minerals or placebo. After fifteen weeks, all groups crossed over to the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) plus vitamins and mineral supplement. P
