Auld Lang Syne
"Auld Lang Syne" is a Scottish poem written by Robert Burns in 1788 and set to the tune of a traditional folk song (Roud # 6294). It is well known in many English-speaking countries and is often sung to celebrate the start of the new year at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Day.
The song's Scots title may be translated into English literally as "old long since", or more idiomatically, "long long ago"[1] or "days gone by". The phrase "Auld Lang Syne" is also used in similar poems by Robert Ayton (1570â€“1638), Allan Ramsay (1686â€“1757), and James Watson (1711) as well as older folk songs predating Burns.[2] In his retelling of fairy tales in the Scots language, Matthew Fitt uses the phrase "In the days of auld lang syne" as the equivalent of "Once upon a time." In Scots syne is pronounced like the English word sign and the trigonometric sine function.

Robert Burns sent a copy of the original song to the Scots Musical Museum with the remark, â€œThe following song, an old song, of the olden times, and which has never been in print, nor even in manuscript until I took it down from an old man".[3] Some of the lyrics were indeed "collected" rather than composed by the poet; the ballad "Old Long Syne" printed in 1711 by James Watson shows considerable similarity in the first verse and the chorus to Burns' later poem.[2] It is a fair supposition to attribute the rest of the poem to Burns himself.[3]
There is some doubt as to whether the melody used today is the same one Burns originally intended, but it is widely used both in Scotland and in the rest of the world. [4]
Singing the song on Hogmanay or New Year's Eve very quickly became a Scots custom that soon spread to other parts of the British Isles. As Scots (and other Britons) emigrated around the world, they took the song with them.
Canadian band leader Guy Lombardo is often credited with popularising the use of the song at New Yearâ€™s celebrations in America, through his annual broadcasts on radio and television, beginning in 1929. The song became his trademark. In addition to his live broadcasts, Lombardo recorded the song more than once. His first recording was in 1939. A later recording on September 29, 1947 was record issued as a single by Decca Records as catalog #24260.[5]
However, earlier newspaper articles describe revellers on both sides of the Atlantic singing the song to usher in the New Year:
A manuscript of "Auld Lang Syne" is held in the permanent collection of The Lilly Library at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana.[8]

As detailed above, auld lang syne literally means "old long since", but a more idiomatic English translation would be something like "long long ago",[1] "days of long ago", or "olden days". "For old times' sake" or "to the (good) old days" may be modern-day expressions, in common use as toasts, that capture the spirit of "for auld lang syne". Although the song begins with a question whether old times should be forgotten, the song is generally interpreted as a call to remember long standing friendships.[9] Thomsonâ€™s Select Songs of Scotland was published in 1799 in which the second verse about greeting and toasting was moved to its present position at the end.[9]
Most common use of the song involves only the first verse and the chorus. Confusion about the exact meaning of the words has led to a common use of "For the sake of" or "For the days of" in the last line, despite this not being part of the traditional lyric.
Should auld acquaintance be forgot,
And never brought to mind ?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot,
And auld lang syne ?
And surely yeâ€™ll be your pint-stowp !
And surely Iâ€™ll be mine !
And weâ€™ll tak a cup oâ€™ kindness yet,
For auld lang syne.
We twa hae run about the braes,
And puâ€™d the gowans fine ;
But weâ€™ve wanderâ€™d mony a weary foot,
Sin auld lang syne.
We twa hae paidlâ€™d i' the burn,
Frae morning sun till dine ;
But seas between us braid hae roarâ€™d
Sin auld lang syne.
And thereâ€™s a hand, my trusty fiere !
And gie's a hand oâ€™ thine !
And weâ€™ll tak a right gude-willy waught,
For auld lang syne.
Shid ald akwentans bee firgot,
an nivir brocht ti mynd?
Shid ald akwentans bee firgot,
an ald lang syn?
An sheerly yil bee yur pynt-staup!
an sheerly al bee myn!
An will tak a cup o kyndnes yet,
fir ald lang syn.
We twa hay rin aboot the braes,
an pood the gowans fyn;
Bit weev wandert monae a weery fet,
sin ald lang syn.
We twa hay pedilt in the burn,
fray mornin sun til dyn;
But seas between us bred hay roard
sin ald lang syn.
An thers a han, my trustee feer!
an gees a han o thyn!
And weâ€™ll tak a richt gude-willie-waucht,
fir ald lang syn.

Should old acquaintance be forgot,
and never brought to mind ?
Should old acquaintance be forgot,
and old times since ?
And surely youâ€™ll buy your pint cup !
And surely Iâ€™ll buy mine !
And we'll take a cup oâ€™ kindness yet,
for auld lang syne.
We two have run about the slopes,
and picked the daisies fine ;
But weâ€™ve wandered many a weary foot,
since auld lang syne.
We two have paddled in the stream,
from morning sun till dineâ€  ;
But seas between us broad have roared
since auld lang syne.
And thereâ€™s a hand my trusty friend !
And give us a hand oâ€™ thine !
And weâ€™ll take a right good-will draught,
for auld lang syne.
â€  dine = dinner time

The tune to which "Auld Lang Syne" is now universally sung is a pentatonic Scots folk melody, probably originally a sprightly dance in a much quicker tempo.[9]
English composer William Shield seems to quote the "Auld Lang Syne" melody briefly at the end of the overture to his opera Rosina, which may be its first recorded use. The contention that Burns borrowed the melody from Shield is for various reasons highly unlikely, although they may very well both have taken it from a common source, possibly a strathspey called The Miller's Wedding or The Miller's Daughter. The problem is that tunes based on the same set of dance steps necessarily have a similar rhythm, and even a superficial resemblance in melodic shape may cause a very strong apparent similarity in the tune as a whole. For instance, Burns' poem "Coming Through the Rye" is sung to a tune that might also be based on the Miller's Wedding. The origin of the tune of God Save the Queen (q.v.) presents a very similar problem, and for just the same reason, as it is also based on a dance measure. (See the note in the William Shield article on this subject.)
Songwriter George M. Cohan quotes "Auld Lang Syne" in the second to last line of the chorus of "You're a Grand Old Flag".


"Auld Lang Syne" is usually sung each year at midnight on Hogmanay (New Year's Eve) in the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Malta, South Africa, Hong Kong, Singapore, Canada, Zimbabwe, and English-speaking areas of India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, and signifies the start of a new year.
In Scotland, it is often sung at the end of a cÃ©ilidh or a dance. It is common practice that everyone joins hands with the person next to them to form a great circle around the dance floor. At the beginning of the last verse, everyone crosses their arms across their breast, so that the right hand reaches out to the neighbour on the left and vice versa. When the tune ends, everyone rushes to the middle, while still holding hands. When the circle is re-established, everyone turns under the arms to end up facing outwards with hands still joined. Outside of Scotland the hands are often crossed from the beginning of the song at variance with Scottish custom.
The Scottish practice was demonstrated by the Queen at the Millennium Dome celebrations for the year 2000. The English press incorrectly berated her for not "properly" crossing her arms, unaware that she was correct.[10][11]
