AnekÄntavÄda (Devanagari: à¤…à¤¨à¥‡à¤•à¤¾à¤¨à¥à¤¤à¤µà¤¾à¤¦) is one of the most important and fundamental doctrines of Jainism. It refers to the principles of pluralism and multiplicity of viewpoints, the notion that truth and reality are perceived differently from diverse points of view, and that no single point of view is the complete truth.[1][2]
This is to contrast attempts to proclaim absolute truth with adhgajanyÄyah, which can be illustrated through the parable of the "blind men and an elephant". In this story, each blind man felt a different part of an elephant (trunk, leg, ear, etc.). All the men claimed to understand and explain the true appearance of the elephant, but could only partly succeed, due to their limited perspectives.[3] This principle is more formally stated by observing that objects are infinite in their qualities and modes of existence, so they cannot be completely grasped in all aspects and manifestations by finite human perception. According to the Jains, only the Kevalinsâ€”the omniscient beingsâ€”can comprehend objects in all aspects and manifestations; others are only capable of partial knowledge.[4] Consequently, no single, specific, human view can claim to represent absolute truth.
The origins of anekÄntavÄda can be traced back to the teachings of MÄhavÄ«ra (599â€“527 BCE), the 24th Jain TÄ«rthaá¹‡kara. The dialectical concepts of syÄdvÄda (conditioned viewpoints) and nayavÄda (partial viewpoints) arose from anekÄntavÄda, providing it with more detailed logical structure and expression. The Sanskrit compound an-eka-anta-vÄda literally means "doctrine of non-exclusivity"; it is translated into English as "scepticism"[5] or "non-absolutism". An-ekÄnta "uncertainty, non-exclusivity" is the opposite of ekÄnta (eka+anta) "exclusiveness, absoluteness, necessity" (or also "monotheistic doctrine").
AnekÄntavÄda encourages its adherents to consider the views and beliefs of their rivals and opposing parties. Proponents of anekÄntavÄda apply this principle to religion and philosophy, reminding themselves that any religion or philosophyâ€”even Jainismâ€”which clings too dogmatically to its own tenets, is committing an error based on its limited point of view.[6] The principle of anekÄntavÄda also influenced Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi to adopt principles of religious tolerance, ahiá¹ƒsÄ and satyagraha.[7]

The etymological root of anekÄntavÄda lies in the compound of two Sanskrit words: anekÄnta ("manifoldness") and vÄda ("school of thought").[8] The word anekÄnta is a compound of the Sanskrit negative prefix an, eka ("singularity"), and anta ("attribute"). Hence, anekÄnta means "not of solitary attribute".[8] The Jain doctrine lays a strong emphasis on samyaktva, that is, rationality and logic.[9] According to Jains, the ultimate principle should always be logical and no principle can be devoid of logic or reason.[9] Thus, the Jain texts contain deliberative exhortations on every subject, whether they are constructive or obstructive, inferential or analytical, enlightening or destructive.[10]

AnekÄntavÄda is one of the three Jain doctrines of relativity used for logic and reasoning. The other two are:
These Jain philosophical concepts made important contributions to ancient Indian philosophy, especially in the areas of skepticism and relativity.[12]

SyÄdvÄda is the theory of conditioned predication which provides an expression to anekÄnta by recommending that the epithet SyÄd be prefixed to every phrase or expression.[13] SyÄdvÄda is not only an extension of anekÄnta ontology, but a separate system of logic capable of standing on its own. The Sanskrit etymological root of the term syÄd is "perhaps" or "maybe", but in the context of syÄdvÄda, it means "in some ways" or "from a perspective". As reality is complex, no single proposition can express the nature of reality fully. Thus the term "syÄt" should be prefixed before each proposition giving it a conditional point of view and thus removing any dogmatism in the statement.[2] Since it ensures that each statement is expressed from seven different conditional and relative viewpoints or propositions, syÄdvÄda is known as saptibhaá¹…gÄ«nÄya or the theory of seven conditioned predications. These seven propositions, also known as saptibhaá¹…gÄ«, are:[14]
Each of these seven propositions examines the complex and multifaceted nature of reality from a relative point of view of time, space, substance and mode.[14] To ignore the complexity of reality is to commit the fallacy of dogmatism.[2]

NayavÄda is the theory of partial standpoints or viewpoints. NayavÄda is a compound of two Sanskrit wordsâ€”naya ("partial viewpoint") and vÄda ("school of thought or debate").[15] It is used to arrive at a certain inference from a point of view. An object has infinite aspects to it, but when we describe an object in practice, we speak of only relevant aspects and ignore irrelevant ones.[15] This does not deny the other attributes, qualities, modes and other aspects; they are just irrelevant from a particular perspective. Authors like Natubhai Shah explain nayavÄda with the example of a car;[16] for instance, when we talk of a "blue BMW" we are simply considering the color and make of the car. However, our statement does not imply that the car is devoid of other attributes like engine type, cylinders, speed, price and the like. This particular viewpoint is called a naya or a partial viewpoint. As a type of critical philosophy, nayavÄda holds that all philosophical disputes arise out of confusion of standpoints, and the standpoints we adopt are, although we may not realize it, "the outcome of purposes that we may pursue".[17] While operating within the limits of language and seeing the complex nature of reality, MÄhavÄ«ra used the language of nayas. Naya, being a partial expression of truth, enables us to comprehend reality part by part.[16]

The age of MÄhavÄ«ra and Buddha was an age of intense intellectual debates, especially on the nature of reality and self. Upanishadic thought postulated the absolute unchanging reality of Brahman and atman and claimed that change was mere illusion.[18] The theory advanced by Buddhists denied the reality of permanence of conditioned phenomena, asserting only interdependence and impermanence.[19] According to the VedÄnta (Upanishadic) conceptual scheme, the Buddhists were wrong in denying permanence and absolutism, and within the Buddhist conceptual scheme, the vedÄntins were wrong in denying the reality of impermanence. The two positions were contradictory and mutually exclusive from each others' point of view.[20] The Jains managed a synthesis of the two uncompromising positions with anekÄntavÄda.[6][20][21] From the perspective of a higher, inclusive level made possible by the ontology and epistemology of anekÄntavÄda and syÄdvÄda, Jains do not see such claims as contradictory or mutually exclusive; instead, they are seen as ekantika or only partially true.[20] The Jain breadth of vision embraces the perspectives of both VedÄnta which, according to Jainism, "recognizes substances but not process", and Buddhism, which "recognizes process but not substance". Jainism, on the other hand, pays equal attention to both substance (dravya) and process (paryaya).[22]
MÄhavÄ«ra's responses to various questions asked by his disciples and recorded in the Jain canon BhagvatisÅ«tra demonstrate recognition that there are complex and multiple aspects to truth and reality and a mutually exclusive approach cannot be taken to explain such reality:
Gautama: Lord! Is the soul permanent or impermanent?
MÄhavÄ«ra: The soul is permanent as well as impermanent. From the point of view of the substance it is eternal. From the point of view of its modes it undergoes birth, decay and destruction and hence impermanent.[23]
â€”BhagvatisÅ«tra, 7:58â€“59
Jayanti: Lord! Of the states of slumber or awakening, which one is better?
MÄhavÄ«ra: For some souls the state of slumber is better, for some souls the states of awakening. Slumber is better for those who are engaged in sinful activities and awakening for those who are engaged in meritorious deeds.[24]
â€” BhagvatisÅ«tra, 12:53â€“54
Thousands of questions were asked and MÄhavÄ«raâ€™s responses suggested a complex and multifaceted reality with each answer qualified from a viewpoint.[25] According to Jainism, even a TÄ«rthaá¹‡kara, who possesses and perceives infinite knowledge, cannot express reality completely because of the limitations of language, which is of human creation.[25]
This philosophical syncretisation of paradox of change through anekÄnta has been acknowledged by modern scholars such as Arvind Sharma, who wrote:[21]
Our experience of the world presents a profound paradox which we can ignore existentially, but not philosophically. This paradox is the paradox of change. Something â€“ A changes and therefore it cannot be permanent. On the other hand, if A is not permanent, then what changes? In this debate between the 'permanence' and 'change', Hinduism seems more inclined to grasp the first horn of the dilemma and Buddhism the second. It is Jainism that has the philosophical courage to grasp both horns fearlessly and simultaneously, and the philosophical skill not to be gored by either.
However, anekÄntavÄda is simply not about syncretisation or compromise between competing ideas, as it is about finding the hidden elements of shared truth between such ideas.[26] AnekÄntavÄda is not about denying the truth; rather truth is acknowledged as an ultimate spiritual goal. For ordinary humans, it is an elusive goal, but they are still obliged to work towards its attainment.[27] AnekÄntavÄda also does not mean compromising or diluting ones own values and principles.[28] On the contrary, it allows us to understand and be tolerant of conflicting and opposing views, while respectfully maintaining the validity of ones own view-point. Hence, John Koller calls anekÄntavÄda as â€“ â€œepistemological respect for view of othersâ€.[29] AnekÄntavÄda, thus, did not prevent the Jain thinkers from defending the truth and validity of their own doctrine while simultaneously respecting and understanding the rival doctrines. Anne Vallely notes that the epistemological respect for other view-points was put to practice when she was invited by Ä€cÄrya Tulsi, the head of Jain TerÄpanthÄ« order, to teach their Jain nuns, the tenets of Christianity. Commenting on their adherence to ahiá¹ƒsÄ and anekÄntavÄda, she says:[30]
The Jain samaá¹‡Ä«s of Ladnun uncompromisingly maintain ahiá¹ƒsÄ to be an eternal and unchangeable moral law. Other views and beliefs that contradict this belief would certainly be challenged, and ultimately rejected. But what is significant, is that both the rejection and retention of views is tempered by the belief that our perception conveys only a partial reality, that reality itself is manifold, and that to that, assume one particular viewpoint is final, is to hold a limited picture of reality.
AnekÄntavÄda is also different from moral relativism. It does not mean conceding that all arguments and all views are equal, but rather logic and evidence determine which views are true, in what respect and to what extent. [29] While employing anekÄntavÄda, the 17th century philosopher monk, YaÅ›ovijaya also cautions against anÄbhigrahika (indiscriminate attachment to all views as being true), which is effectively a kind of misconceived relativism. [31] Jains thus consider anekÄntavÄda as a positive concept corresponding to religious pluralism that transcends monism and dualism, implying a sophisticated conception of a complex reality.[32] It does not merely involve rejection of partisanship, but reflects a positive spirit of reconciliation of opposite views. However, it is argued that pluralism often degenerates to some form of moral relativism or religious exclusivism.[33] According to Anne Vallely, anekÄnta is a way out of this epistemological quagmire, as it makes a genuinely pluralistic view possible without lapsing into extreme moral relativism or exclusivity.[33]

The ancient Jain texts often explain the concepts of anekÄntvÄda and syÄdvÄda with the parable of the blind men and an elephant (AndhgajanyÄyah), which addresses the manifold nature of truth.[3]
A group of blind men heard that a strange animal, called an elephant, had been brought to the town, but none of them were aware of its shape and form. Out of curiosity, they said: "We must inspect and know it by touch, of which we are capable". So, they sought it out, and when they found it they groped about it. In the case of the first person, whose hand landed on the trunk, said "This being is like a drain pipe". For another one whose hand reached its ear, it seemed like a kind of fan. As for another person, whose hand was upon its leg, said, "I perceive the shape of the elephant to be like a pillar". And in the case of the one who placed his hand upon its back said, "Indeed, this elephant is like a throne". Now, each of these presented a true aspect when he related what he had gained from experiencing the elephant. None of them had strayed from the true description of the elephant. Yet they fell short of fathoming the true appearance of the elephant.
Two of the many references to this parable are found in Tattvarthaslokavatika of Vidyanandi (9th century) and SyÄdvÄdamanjari of Ä€cÄrya Mallisena (13th century). Mallisena uses the parable to argue that immature people deny various aspects of truth; deluded by the aspects they do understand, they deny the aspects they don't understand. "Due to extreme delusion produced on account of a partial viewpoint, the immature deny one aspect and try to establish another. This is the maxim of the blind (men) and the elephant."[34] Mallisena also cites the parable when noting the importance of considering all viewpoints in obtaining a full picture of reality. "It is impossible to properly understand an entity consisting of infinite properties without the method of modal description consisting of all viewpoints, since it will otherwise lead to a situation of seizing mere sprouts (i.e., a superficial, inadequate cognition), on the maxim of the blind (men) and the elephant."[35]

The principle of anekÄntavÄda is the foundation of many Jain philosophical concepts. The development of anekÄntavÄda also encouraged the development of the dialectics of syÄdvÄda (conditioned viewpoints), saptibhaá¹…gÄ« (the seven conditioned predication), and nayavÄda (partial viewpoints).

The origins of anekÄntavÄda lie in the teachings of MÄhavÄ«ra, who used it effectively to show the relativity of truth and reality. Taking a relativistic viewpoint, MÄhavÄ«ra is said to have explained the nature of the soul as both permanent, from the point of view of underlying substance, and temporary, from the point of view of its modes and modification.[23] The importance and antiquity of anekÄntavÄda are also demonstrated by the fact that it formed the subject matter of Astinasti PravÄda, the fourth part of the lost Purva that contained teachings of the TÄ«rthaá¹‡karas prior to MÄhavÄ«ra. German Indologist Hermann Jacobi believes MÄhavÄ«ra effectively employed the dialectics of anekÄntavÄda to refute the agnosticism of SaÃ±jaya Belaá¹­á¹­haputta.[36] Sutrakritanga, the second oldest canon of Jainism, contains the first references to syÄdvÄda and saptibhaá¹…gÄ«. According to SÅ«trakritanga, MÄhavÄ«ra advised his disciples to use syÄdv
