Yoga (Sanskrit, PÄli: à¤¯à¥‹à¤—, IAST: yÃ³ga, IPA: [joËgÉ™]) refers to traditional physical and mental disciplines originating in India.[1] The word is associated with meditative practices in both Buddhism and Hinduism.[2][3] In Hinduism, it also refers to one of the six orthodox (Ästika) schools of Hindu philosophy, and to the goal toward which that school directs its practices.[4][5]
Major branches of yoga include Raja Yoga, Karma Yoga, Jnana Yoga, Bhakti Yoga, and Hatha Yoga.[6][7][8] Raja Yoga, compiled in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, and known simply as yoga in the context of Hindu philosophy, is part of the Samkhya tradition.[9] Many other Hindu texts discuss aspects of yoga, including Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, the Hatha Yoga Pradipika, the Shiva Samhita and various Tantras.
The Sanskrit word yoga has many meanings,[10] and is derived from the Sanskrit root yuj, meaning "to control", "to yoke" or "to unite".[11] Translations include "joining", "uniting", "union", "conjunction", and "means".[12][13][14] Outside India, the term yoga is typically associated with Hatha Yoga and its asanas (postures) or as a form of exercise. An accomplished practitioner of Yoga is called a Yogi (gender neutral) or Yogini (feminine form).

The Vedic Samhitas contain references to ascetics, while ascetic practices (tapas) are referenced in the BrÄhmaá¹‡as (900 B.C.E. and 500 B.C.E.), early commentaries on the Vedas.[15] Several seals discovered at Indus Valley Civilization (c. 3300â€“1700 B.C.E.) sites depict what may be figures in a yoga- or meditation-like posture, "a form of ritual discipline, suggesting a precursor of yoga", according to archaeologist Gregory Possehl.[16] Gavin Flood states that it is not clear that the 'Pashupati' figure on these seals is seated in a yoga posture, or that the shape is even intended to represent a human figure at all.[17][18]
Techniques for experiencing higher states of consciousness in meditation initially had only a slight philosophical underpinning, and were unconnected with Samkhya doctrines.[19] These techniques were developed by the shramanic traditions and in the Upanshadic tradition.[20] An early textual reference to meditation is made in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, the earliest Upanishad (approx. 900 B.C.E.).[21] The Buddhist texts are probably the earliest texts describing meditation techniques.[22] In Hindu literature, the term "yoga" first occurs in the Katha Upanishad, where it refers to control of the senses and the cessation of mental activity leading to a supreme state.[23] Important textual sources for the evolving concept of Yoga are the middle Upanishads, (ca. 400 B.C.E), the Mahabharata including the Bhagavad Gita (ca. 200 B.C.E), and the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali (300 B.C.-200 B.C.E).

In Indian philosophy, Yoga is the name of one of the six orthodox philosophical schools.[24][25] The Yoga philosophical system is closely allied with the Samkhya school.[26] The Yoga school as expounded by the sage Patanjali accepts the Samkhya psychology and metaphysics, but is more theistic than the Samkhya, as evidenced by the addition of a divine entity to the Samkhya's twenty-five elements of reality.[27][28] The parallels between Yoga and Samkhya were so close that Max MÃ¼ller says that "the two philosophies were in popular parlance distinguished from each other as Samkhya with and Samkhya without a Lord...."[29] The intimate relationship between Samkhya and Yoga is explained by Heinrich Zimmer:
These two are regarded in India as twins, the two aspects of a single discipline. SÄá¹…khya provides a basic theoretical exposition of human nature, enumerating and defining its elements, analyzing their manner of co-operation in a state of bondage (bandha), and describing their state of disentanglement or separation in release (moká¹£a), while Yoga treats specifically of the dynamics of the process for the disentanglement, and outlines practical techniques for the gaining of release, or 'isolation-integration' (kaivalya).[30]
Patanjali is widely regarded as the founder of the formal Yoga philosophy.[31] Patanjali's yoga is known as Raja yoga, which is a system for control of the mind.[32] Patanjali defines the word "yoga" in his second sutra,[33] which is the definitional sutra for his entire work:
à¤¯à¥‹à¤—: à¤šà¤¿à¤¤à¥à¤¤-à¤µà¥ƒà¤¤à¥à¤¤à¤¿ à¤¨à¤¿à¤°à¥‹à¤§:
( yogaÅ› citta-vá¹›tti-nirodhaá¸¥ )
- Yoga Sutras 1.2
This terse definition hinges on the meaning of three Sanskrit terms. I. K. Taimni translates it as "Yoga is the inhibition (nirodhaá¸¥) of the modifications (vá¹›tti) of the mind (citta)".[34] The use of the word nirodhaá¸¥ in the opening definition of yoga is an example of the important role that Buddhist technical terminology and concepts play in the Yoga Sutra; this role suggests that Patanjali was aware of Buddhist ideas and wove them into his system.[35] Swami Vivekananda translates the sutra as "Yoga is restraining the mind-stuff (Citta) from taking various forms (Vrittis)."[36]
Patanjali's writing also became the basis for a system referred to as "Ashtanga Yoga" ("Eight-Limbed Yoga"). This eight-limbed concept derived from the 29th Sutra of the 2nd book, and is a core characteristic of practically every Raja yoga variation taught today. The Eight Limbs are:
In the view of this school, the highest attainment does not reveal the experienced diversity of the world to be illusion. The everyday world is real. Furthermore, the highest attainment is the event of one of many individual selves discovering itself; there is no single universal self shared by all persons.[37]

The Bhagavad Gita ('Song of the Lord'), uses the term yoga extensively in a variety of ways. In addition to an entire chapter (ch. 6) dedicated to traditional yoga practice, including meditation,[38] it introduces three prominent types of yoga:[39]
Madhusudana Sarasvati (b. circa 1490) divided the Gita into three sections, with the first six chapters dealing with Karma yoga, the middle six with Bhakti yoga, and the last six with Jnana (knowledge).[40] Other commentators ascribe a different 'yoga' to each chapter, delineating eighteen different yogas.[41]

Hatha Yoga is a particular system of Yoga described by Yogi Swatmarama, compiler of the Hatha Yoga Pradipika in 15th century India. Hatha Yoga differs substantially from the Raja Yoga of Patanjali in that it focuses on shatkarma, the purification of the physical body as leading to the purification of the mind (ha), and prana, or vital energy (tha).[42][43] Compared to the seated asana, or sitting meditation posture, of Patanjali's Raja yoga,[44] it marks the development of asanas (plural) into the full body 'postures' now in popular usage.[45] Hatha Yoga in its many modern variations is the style that many people associate with the word "Yoga" today.[46]


Early Buddhism incorporated meditative absorption states.[47] The most ancient sustained expression of yogic ideas is found in the early sermons of the Buddha.[48]

Yogacara (Sanskrit: "yoga practice"[49]), also spelled yogÄchÄra, is a school of philosophy and psychology that developed in India during the 4th to 5th centuries. Yogacara received the name as it provided a yoga, a framework for engaging in the practices that lead to the path of the bodhisattva.[50] The Yogacara sect teaches yoga in order to reach enlightenment.[51]

Zen (the name of which derives from the Sanskrit "dhyaana" via the Chinese "ch'an"[52]) is a form of Mahayana Buddhism. The Mahayana school of Buddhism is noted for its proximity with Yoga.[47] In the west, Zen is often set alongside Yoga; the two schools of meditation display obvious family resemblances.[53] This phenomenon merits special attention since the Zen Buddhist school of meditation has some of its roots in yogic practices.[54] Certain essential elements of Yoga are important both for Buddhism in general and for Zen in particular.[55]

Yoga is central to Tibetan Buddhism. In the Nyingma tradition, practitioners progress to increasingly profound levels of yoga, starting with MahÄ yoga, continuing to Anu yoga and ultimately undertaking the highest practice, Ati yoga. In the Sarma traditions, the Anuttara yoga class is equivalent. Other tantra yoga practices include a system of 108 bodily postures practiced with breath and heart rhythm. Timing in movement exercises is known as Trul khor or union of moon and sun (channel) prajna energies. The body postures of Tibetan ancient yogis are depicted on the walls of the Dalai Lama's summer temple of Lukhang. A semi-popular account of Tibetan Yoga by Chang (1993) refers to Dumo, the generation of heat in one's own body, as being "the very foundation of the whole of Tibetan Yoga".[56] Chang also claims that Tibetan Yoga involves reconciliation of apparent polarities, such as prana and mind, relating this to theoretical implications of tantrism.

The development of Sufism was considerably influenced by Indian yogic practises, where they adapted both physical postures (asanas) and breath control (pranayama).[57] The ancient Indian yogic text, Amritakunda, ("Pool of Nectar)" was translated into Arabic and Persian as early as the 11th century.[58]
Malaysia's top Islamic body in 2008 passed a fatwa, which is legally non-binding, against Muslims practicing yoga, saying it had elements of "Hindu spiritual teachings" and could lead to blasphemy and is therefore haraam. Muslim yoga teachers in Malaysia criticized the decision as "insulting".[59] Sisters in Islam, a women's rights group in Malaysia, also expressed disappointment and said they would continue with their yoga classes.[60] The fatwa states that yoga practiced only as physical exercise is permissible, but prohibits the chanting of religious mantras,[61] and states that teachings such as uniting of a human with God is not consistent with Islamic philosophy.[62] In a similar vein, the Council of Ulemas, an Islamic body in Indonesia, passed a fatwa banning yoga on the grounds that it contains "Hindu elements"[63] These fatwas have, in turn, been criticized by Darul Uloom Deoband, a Deobandi Islamic seminary in India.[64]

In 1989, the Vatican declared that Eastern meditation practices such as Zen and yoga can "degenerate into a cult of the body." In spite of the Vatican statement, many Roman Catholics bring elements of Yoga, Buddhism, and Hinduism into their spiritual practices.[65] ........... [Br.
