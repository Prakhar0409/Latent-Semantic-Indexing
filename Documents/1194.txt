Sun Wukong
Sun Wukong (traditional Chinese: Â≠´ÊÇüÁ©∫; simplified Chinese: Â≠ôÊÇüÁ©∫; pinyin: S≈´n W√πk≈çng; Wade-Giles: Sun1 Wu4-k'ung1; Vietnamese: T√¥n Ng·ªô Kh√¥ng; Japanese Â≠´ÊÇüÁ©∫ (Son Gok≈´ ?)), known in the West as the Monkey King, is the main character in the classical Chinese epic novel Journey to the West. In the novel, he accompanies the monk Xuanzang on the journey to retrieve Buddhist sutras from India.
Sun Wukong possesses an immense amount of strength, being able to lift his 13,500 jƒ´n (8,100†kg) Ruyi Jingu Bang with ease. He also has superb speed, traveling 108,000 li (54,000 kilometers) in one somersault. Sun knows 72 transformations, which allows him to transform into various animals and objects; he is, however, shown with slight problems transforming into other people, since he is unable to complete the transformation of his tail. He is a skilled fighter, capable of holding his own against the best generals of heaven. Each of his hairs possesses magical properties, and is capable of transforming into a clone of the Monkey King himself, or various weapons, animals, and other objects. He also knows various spells in order to command wind, part water, conjure protective circles against demons, freeze humans, demons, and gods alike.[1]


Sun Wukong was born from a mythical stone formed from the primal forces of chaos, located on the HuƒÅgu«í-shƒÅn (Chinese: Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±Ôºõmountain of flowers and fruit). After joining a clan of monkeys, he earned their respect by discovering the Shu«êli√°n-d√≤ng (Chinese: Ê∞¥Â∏òÊ¥ûÔºõwater-curtain cave) behind a large waterfall; the clan made it their new home. The other monkeys honored him as their king, and he called himself Mƒõi H√≥uw√°ng (handsome monkey king). He soon realized that despite his power over the monkeys, he was not beyond mortality. Determined to find immortality, he traveled on a raft to civilized lands, where he found and became the disciple of a Buddhist/Taoist Patriarch Bodhi. He was able to acquire human speech and manners through his travels.[1]
Bodhi was initially reluctant to take him because he was not human; but the monkey's determination and perseverance impressed the patriarch. It was from him that the monkey received his official name Sun Wukong ("Sun" implies his origin as a monkey, and "Wukong" means aware of emptiness). Soon, his eagerness and intelligence made him one of the favorite disciples of the patriarch, whose guidance and training taught the monkey a number of magic arts. He acquired the powers of shapeshifting known as the "72 transformations", supposedly the more versatile and difficult set of skills that allows him to transform into every possible form of existence, including people and objects. He also learned about cloud-traveling, including a technique called the Jƒ´nd«íuy√∫n (cloud-somersault), which covers 108,000 li (54,000†km) in a single flip. Finally, he could transform each of the 84,000 hairs on his body into inanimate objects and living beings, or even clones of himself. Sun Wukong became proud of his abilities, and began boasting to the other disciples. Bodhi was not happy with this, and cast him out of his temple. Before they parted, Bodhi ordered that Sun Wukong promise never to tell anyone how he acquired his powers[1].
At HuƒÅgu«í-shƒÅn, Sun Wukong established himself as one of the most powerful and influential demons in the world. In search of a weapon worthy of himself, Sun Wukong traveled into the oceans, where he acquired the Golden-banded fighting staff Ruyi Jingu Bang (also known as Lork bong Jin Jan in Khmer), which could change its size, multiply itself, and fight according to the whim of its master. It was originally used by D√†-Y«î to measure ocean depth and later became the "Pillar that pacifies the oceans", a treasure of Ao Guang, the "dragon-king of the Eastern Seas". It weighed 13,500 jin (8.1 tons). Upon Sun Wukong's approach, the pillar started to glow, signifying that it had found its true master. Its versatility meant that Sun Wukong could wield it as a staff and keep it inside his ear as a sewing needle. This drove fear into the magical beings of the sea and threw the sea itself into confusion, since nothing but the pillar itself could control the ebb and flow of the ocean's tides. In addition to taking the magical staff, Wukong also defeated the dragons of the four seas in battle and forced them to give him golden chain mail (ÈéñÂ≠êÈªÉÈáëÁî≤), a phoenix-feather cap (È≥≥ÁøÖÁ¥´ÈáëÂÜ† F√®ngch√¨z«êjinguƒÅn), and cloud-walking boots (ËóïÁµ≤Ê≠•Èõ≤Â±• «ëusƒ´b√πy√∫nl«ö). Sun Wukong then defied Hell's attempt to collect his soul. Instead of reincarnating like all other living beings, he wiped his name out of the "Book of Life and Death" and with it the names of all other monkeys known to him. The Dragon Kings and the Kings of Hell then decided to report him to the Jade Emperor of Heaven.[1]

Hoping that a promotion and a rank amongst the gods would make him more manageable, the Jade Emperor invited Sun Wukong to Heaven, where the monkey believed he would receive an honorable place as one of the gods. Instead, he was made the head of Heavenly Stables to watch over horses. When he discovered this, Sun Wukong rebelled and proclaimed himself the "Great Sage, Equal of Heaven", and allied with some of the most powerful demons on earth. The Heavens' initial attempt at subduing the Monkey King was unsuccessful; although they were forced to recognize his title, however, they attempted to put him off as the guardian of Heavenly Garden. When he found that he was excluded from a royal banquet that included every other important god and goddess, Sun Wukong's indignation again turned to open defiance. After stealing Xi Wangmu's "peaches of immortality", Lao Tzu's "pills of longevity", and the Jade Emperor's royal wine, he escaped back to his kingdom in preparation for his rebellion.
Sun Wukong later defeated the Army of Heaven's 100,000 celestial warriors - each fight an equivalent of a cosmic embodiment, including all 28 constellations, four heavenly kings, and Nezha - and proved himself equal to the best of Heaven's generals, Erlang Shen. Eventually, through the teamwork of Taoist and Buddhist forces, including the efforts from some of the greatest deities, Sun Wukong was captured. After several failed attempts at execution, Sun Wukong was locked into Lao Tzu's eight-way trigram cauldron to be distilled into an elixir by the most sacred and the most severe samadhi fires. After 49 days, the cauldron exploded and Sun Wukong jumped out, stronger than ever. He now had the ability to recognize evil in any form through his hu«íy«én-jƒ´njƒ´ng (ÁÅ´ÁúºÈáëÁùõ) (lit. "fiery-eyes golden-gaze"), an eye condition that also gave him a weakness to smoke.
With all of their options exhausted, the Jade Emperor and the authorities of Heaven appealed to the Buddha, who arrived from his temple in the West. The Buddha made a bet with Sun Wukong that he (Sun Wukong) could not escape from his (Buddha's) palm. Sun Wukong, knowing that he could cover 108,000 li in one leap, smugly agreed. He took a great leap and then flew to the end of the world in seconds. Nothing was visible except for five pillars, and Wukong surmised that he had reached the ends of Heaven. To prove his trail, he marked the pillars with a phrase declaring himself "the great sage equal to heaven". Afterward, he leaped back and landed in the Buddha's palm. There, he was surprised to find that the five "pillars" he had found were in fact the five fingers of the Buddha's hand. When Wukong tried to escape, the Buddha turned his hand into a mountain. Before Wukong could shrug it off, the Buddha sealed him there using a paper talisman on which was written the mantra Om Mani Padme Hum in gold letters, wherein Sun Wukong remained imprisoned for five centuries.[1]

Five centuries later, the bodhisattva Guanyin went out in search for disciples that could protect a pilgrim from the East to journey to India to retrieve the Buddhist sutras. In hearing this, Sun Wukong offered to serve this pilgrim, by name Xuanzang, a monk of the Tang Dynasty Empire, in exchange for his freedom. Guanyin understood that the monkey would be hard to control, and therefore gave Xuanzang a gift from the Buddha: a magical headband which, once Sun Wukong was tricked into putting it on, could never be removed. With a special chant, the band would tighten and cause unbearable pain to the monkey's head. To be fair, she also gave Sun Wukong three special hairs, which could be used in dire emergencies. Under Xuanzang's supervision, Sun Wukong was allowed to journey to the West.
Throughout the epic Journey to the West, Sun Wukong faithfully helped Xuanzang on his journey to India. They were joined by "Pigsy" (Áå™ÂÖ´Êàí Zhu Bajie) and "Sandy" (Ê≤ôÊÇüÊµÑ Sha Wujing), both of whom offered to accompany the priest in order to atone for their previous crimes. It was later revealed that the priest's horse was in fact a dragon prince. Xuanzang's safety was constantly under threat from demons and other supernatural beings who believed that his flesh, once consumed, would bring them longevity, wherefore Sun Wukong often acted as his bodyguard and given free access to the powers of Heaven to combat these threats. The group encountered a series of eighty-one tribulations before accomplishing their mission and returning safely to China. There, Sun Wukong was granted Buddhahood for his service and strength.[1]


The Sun Wukong festival is celebrated on the sixteenth day of the eighth lunar month on the Chinese calendar. Festivals feature recreations of his ordeals such as walking on a bed of coals and climbing a ladder of knives.
In Hong Kong the festival is celebrated at the Buddhist Temple in Sau Mau Ping, which contains a shrine to Sun Wukong.

Mao Zedong consistently used Sun Wukong as a role model, and often spoke about the good example of the Monkey King, citing "his fearlessness in thinking, doing work, striving for the objective and extricating China from poverty".[2]

In spite of their popularity (or perhaps because of it), legends regarding Sun Wukong have changed with Chinese culture. The tale with Buddha and the "Pillars" is a prime example, and did not appear until Buddhism was introduced to China during the Han Dynasty. Various legends concerning Sun Wukong date back to before written Chinese history. They tend to change and adapt to the most popular Chinese religion of a given era.
In his book The Shaolin Monastery (2008), Tel Aviv University Prof. Meir Shahar claims that Sun influenced a legend concerning the origins of the Shaolin staff method. The legend takes place during the Red Turban Rebellion of the Yuan Dynasty. Bandits lay siege to the monastery, but it is saved by a lowly kitchen worker wielding a long fire poker as a makeshift staff. He leaps into the oven and emerges as a monstrous giant big enough to stand astride both Mount Song and the imperial fort atop Mount Shaoshi (which are five miles apart). The bandits flee when they behold him. The Shaolin monks later realize that the kitchen worker was the Monastery's guardian deity, Vajrapani, in disguise. Shahar compares the worker's transformation in the stove with Sun Wukong's time in Laozi's crucible, their use of the staff, and the fact that Sun Wukong and his weapon can both grow to gigantic proportions.[4]

In addition to the names used in the novel, the Monkey King has other names in different languages:

Sun Wukong has been a staple character in many forms of media from many East Asian countries, most famously the 1965 Chinese animated film Havoc in Heaven.

Many actors including Masaaki Sakai, Liu Xiao Ling Tong, Stephen Chow, Yueh Hua (of Shaw Brothers fame), and Dicky Cheung have portrayed Sun Wukong in films and television shows. Jet Li portrays the character in the 2008 movie The Forbidden Kingdom, which condenses many of the elements of his character (his mischief, his playing havoc amongst the gods, his magical staff obtained from the Dragon King of the Eastern Sea, and his three magical hairs) into a single narrative.
The 1960 Japanese animated feature Alakazam the Great was based on a manga adaptation of 'Journey to the West' created by Osamu Tezuka.
Sun was also portrayed in the 1983 NBC special Big Bird in China. He was the guide of Big Bird, Barkley, and their young friend, Xiao Foo, while they searched for Feng Huang.
In 1985, filmmaker Chris Columbus wrote an early draft for the third Indiana Jones film (which eventually became Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade), which featured the Monkey King. In Columbus' first draft, Sun Wu Kung (as it is spelt there) is benevolent deity and god to a city of pygmies and apes in Africa; but in the second draft he is a villain. George Lucas eventually decided the character was too unrealistic [5]. The script was leaked online in 1997, and many believed it was an early draft for the fourth film as the date was mistakenly printed as 1995.[6].
In 1986 in was filmed Chinese serial Monkey King (Xi you ji, directed by Jie Yang), which featured 25 episodes of length from 40 to 55 minutes. It tells story of Monkey king Sun Wukong from his birth from rock and sea through his journey.
The anime, Saiyuki, portrayed the monkey king as Son Goku. Kazuya Minekura, the author of the manga, took the legend and made alterations to appeal to a teenage audience.
The manga and anime series Dragon Ball was based on Journey to the West, and the protagonist was named Son Goku (the Japanese way to pronounce the kanji Sun Wukong). Although Goku had a few items in his possession similar to the Monkey King (such as a somersault cloud and an extending magical staff), he appeared to be more human than monkey (he is later revealed to be a member of a race of monkey-tailed aliens called Saiyans), and his initial mischievous behavior stems from his youth and innocence, rather than from arrogance and sometimes outright malice.
The manga and anime Love Hina have both a chapter where characters play the Journey to the West.
