Calorie restriction
Calorie restriction, or caloric restriction (CR), is a dietary regimen thought to improve health and slow the aging process by limiting dietary energy intake. Calorie restriction is a common measure found in several dietary regimens, including the Okinawa diet [1] and the CRON-diet.


In human subjects, CR has been shown to lower cholesterol, fasting glucose, and blood pressure.[citation needed] In CR, energy intake is minimized, but sufficient quantities of vitamins, minerals and other important nutrients must be eaten.
A small-scale study in the US at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis studied the effects following a calorie-restricted diet of 10-25% less calorie intake than the average Western diet. Body mass index (BMI) was significantly lower in the calorie-restricted group when compared with the matched group; 19.6 compared with 25.9. The BMI values for the comparison group are similar to the mean BMI values for middle-aged people in the US.[2]
All those on calorie-restricted diets experienced reductions in BMI after starting their diet. Their BMIs decreased from an average of 24 (range of 29.6 to 19.4) to an average of 19.5 (range of 22.8 to 16.5) over the course of their dieting (3-15 years). Nearly all the decrease in BMI occurred in the first year of dieting. It was found that the average total cholesterol and LDL (bad) cholesterol levels for calorie-restricted individuals were the equivalent of those found in the lowest 10% of normal people in their age group. It was found that the average HDL (good) cholesterol levels for calorie-restricted individuals were very highâ€”in the 85th to 90th percentile range for normal middle-aged US men. These positive changes in calorie-restricted individuals were found to occur mainly in the first year of dieting. [2]
"The calorie-restricted group also fared much better than the control group in terms of average blood pressure (100/60 vs. 130/80 mm Hg), fasting glucose, fasting insulin (65% reduction), body mass index (19.6 Â± 1.9 vs. 25.9 Â± 3.2 kg/m2), body fat percentage (8.7% Â± 7% vs. 24% Â± 8%), C-reactive protein, carotid IMT (40% reduction), and platelet-derived growth factor AB."[3]
It was found that the calorie-restricted group had remarkably low triglyceride levels. In fact, they were as low as the lowest 5% of Americans in their 20s. This is more remarkable when it is noted that the calorie-restricted individuals were actually aged between 35 and 82 years. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels in calorie-restricted group were remarkably low, about 100/60, values normally found in 10-year-old children. Fasting plasma insulin concentration was 65% lower and fasting plasma glucose concentration was also significantly lower in the calorie-restricted group when compared with the comparison group." The comparison group's statistics aligned approximately with the US national average on the dimensions considered.[4] Fasting plasma insulin levels[5] and fasting plasma glucose levels[6] are used as tests to predict diabetes. The researchers also found that "excessive calorie restriction causes malnutrition and can lead to anemia, muscle wasting, weakness, dizziness, lethargy, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, gallstones, irritability and depression". The study was published in the March 2007 issue of the Journal of American Medical Association.[2]
While compelling, these studies used borderline overweight (BMI>25) subjects as controls, which is the average in some countries but not in others. It remains unclear whether the same effects would also be observed if non-overweight subjects were used as controls.

A 2009 research paper showed that a calorie restricted diet can improve memory in normal to overweight elderly. The diet as well resulted in decreased insulin levels and reduced signs of inflammation.[7] Scientists believe memory improvement on that experiment was caused by the lower insulin levels, because high insulin levels are usually associated with lower memory and cognitive function.[8] However, that relation seems to be age specific since another study, when analyzing people older than 65, those who were underweight had a higher dementia risk than normal or overweight people, where the latter had a lower risk than the other two conditions.[9]


Being on a CR diet can lead to an individual becoming underweight. One study has shown that having a BMI lower than 18 is associated with significantly increased mortality from noncancer, nonâˆ’cardiovascular disease causes. The results were the same when not accounting for those who were underweight because they might have been already sick or were smokers. However, the study focused solely on BMI and did not look specifically at diet.[10]

When in prolonged periods of severe caloric restriction the body burns lean tissue (including but not limited to muscle) along with its remaining fat reserves.[11]. This typically occurs after long periods of starvation in which the majority of body fat reserves have been almost completely depleted. The combination of starvation and the associated lethargy and decreased physical activity can result in muscular atrophy which leads to lower quality of life.[12][13] In the final stages of starvation the breakdown of tissues to supply energy can have its own adverse effects on the body.[citation needed]

When reducing calorie intake, intake of essential nutrients may also be reduced, especially fat-soluble vitamins, which require fat for proper absorption and others nutrients generally associated with high calorie foods, like nuts, meat and dairy products.

When undernourished the body slows the growth rate of hair and nails.[14]

Hypoglycemia can lead to neuroglycopenia.

In 1934, Mary Crowell and Clive McCay of Cornell University observed that laboratory rats fed a severely reduced calorie diet while maintaining vital nutrient levels resulted in life spans of up to twice as long as otherwise expected. These findings were explored in detail by a series of experiments with mice conducted by Roy Walford and his student Richard Weindruch. In 1986, Weindruch reported that restricting the calorie intake of laboratory mice proportionally increased their life span compared to a group of mice with a normal diet. The calorie-restricted mice also maintained youthful appearances and activity levels longer and showed delays in age-related diseases. The results of the many experiments by Walford and Weindruch were summarized in their book The Retardation of Aging and Disease by Dietary Restriction (1988) (ISBN 0-398-05496-7).
The findings have since been accepted and generalized to a range of other animals. Researchers are investigating the possibility of parallel physiological links in humans. In the meantime, many people have independently adopted the practice of calorie restriction in some form.
Trials were set up at Washington University in 2002 and involved about thirty participants. Dr. Luigi Fontana, clinical investigator, says CR practitioners seem to be aging more slowly than the rest of us. "Take systolic blood pressure," he says. "Usually, that rises with age reliably, partly because the arteries are hardening. In my group, mean age is 55, and mean systolic blood pressure is 110: thatâ€™s at the level of a 20-year-old."
A study conducted by the Salk Institute for Biological Studies and published in the journal Nature in May 2007 determined that the gene PHA-4 is responsible for the longevity behind calorie restriction in animals, 'with similar results expected in humans'.[15] The discovery has given hope to the synthesising of future drugs to increase the human lifespan by simulating the effects of calorie restriction. However, MIT biologist Leonard Guarente cautioned that "(treatment) won't be a substitute for a healthy lifestyle. You'll still need to go to the gym".[16]


Researchers at New York's Mount Sinai School of Medicine reported in 2006 that compared to monkeys fed a normal diet, squirrel monkeys on a life-long calorie-restrictive diet were less likely to develop Alzheimer's-like changes in their brains.[17] Since squirrel monkeys are relatively long-lived, definitive conclusions regarding whether or not they are aging slower are not yet available. A study on rhesus macaques was started in 1989 at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Preliminary results show lower fasting insulin and glucose levels as well as higher insulin sensitivity and LDL profiles associated with lower risk of atherogenesis in dietary restricted animals.[18]

Studies in female mice have shown that estrogen receptor-alpha declines in the pre-optic hypothalamus as they age. The female mice that were given a calorically restricted diet during the majority of their lives maintained higher levels of ERÎ± in the pre-optic hypothalamus than their non-calorically restricted counterparts.[19] Studies in female mice have shown that both Supraoptic nucleus (SON) and Paraventricular nucleus (PVN) lose about one-third of IGF-1R immunoreactive cells with normal aging. Old caloricly restricted (CR) mice lost higher numbers of IGF-1R non-immunoreactive cells while maintaining similar counts of IGF-1R immunoreactive cells in comparison to Old-Al mice. Consequently, Old-CR mice show a higher percentage of IGF-1R immunoreactive cells reflecting increased hypothalamic sensitivity to IGF-1 in comparison to normally aging mice.[20][21]

Seventy years ago, McCay CM, et al., discovered that reducing the amount of calories fed to rats nearly doubled their lifespan. For the last seventy years, scientists have proposed hypotheses as to why. Some explanations included reduced cellular divisions, lower metabolism rates, and reduced production of free radicals generated by metabolism.

Fungi model are very easy to manipulate and many crucial steps toward the understanding of aging has been done with it. Many studies were published in budding yeast and fission yeast to analyse the cellular mechanisms behind the increased longevity due to calorie restriction. First, calorie restriction is often called dietary restriction because the same effects on life span can be reached only by changing the nutrient quality wihtout changing the amout of calorie. The data from Dr Guarente, Dr Kennedy, Dr Jazwinski, Dr Kaeberlein, Dr Longo, Dr Shadel, Dr NystrÃ¶m, Dr Piper and others showed that genetic manipulations in nutrient signaling pathways could mimic the effects of dietary restriction. In some case dietary restriction needs mitochondrial respiration to increase longevity (chronological aging) and in some other case not (replicative aging). Nutrient sensing in yeast controls stress defense, mitochondrial functions, Sir2 and others. These functions are all known to regulate aging. Genes involved in these mechanisms are : TOR, PKA, SCH9, MSN2/4, RIM15, SIR2,... [22] [23] [24] [25] [26]

Research in 2003 by Mair et al. showed that calorie restriction extends the life of fruit flies of any age with instantaneous effects on death rates.[27]

Recent work in Caenorhabditis elegans has shown that restriction of glucose metabolism extends life span by primarily increasing oxidative stress to exert an ultimately increased resistance against oxidative stress, a process called (mito)hormesis.[citation needed]

There have been many theories as to how CR works, and many of them have fallen out of favor or been disproved. These include reduced basal metabolic rate, developmental delay, the control animals being gluttons, and decreased glucocorticoid production.

A small number of researchers in the CR field are now proponents of a new theory known as the "Hormesis hypothesis of CR" also known as the "Mitohormesis hypothesis of CR" due to the likely involvement of mitochondria. Southam and Ehrlich (1943) reported that a bark extract that was known to inhibit fungal growth, actually stimulated growth when given at very low concentrations. They coined the term "hormesis" to describe such beneficial actions resulting from the response of an organism to a low-intensity biological stressor. The word "hormesis" is derived from the Greek word "hormaein" which means "to excite".
The (Mito)hormesis hypothesis of CR proposes that the diet imposes a low-intensity biological stress on the organism, which elicits a defense response that helps protect it against the causes of aging. In other words, CR places the organism in a defensive state so that it can survive adversity, and this results in improved health and longer life. This switch to a defensive state may be controlled by longevity genes (see below).
While the (Mito)hormesis hypothesis of CR was a purely hypothetical concept until late 2007, recent work by Michael Ristow's group in a small worm named Caenorhabditis elegans has shown that restriction of glucose metabolism extends life span by primarily increasing oxidative stress to exert an ultimately increased resistance against oxidative stress.[28] This is probably the first experimental evidence for hormesis being an essential cause for extended life span following CR.

Lowering of the concentration of insulin and substanses which are related to insulin, e.g Insulin-like growth factor 1 and Growth hormone has been shown to upregulate autophagy, the repair mechanism of the cell [29]
Early work in C. elegans (see Cynthia Kenyon) and more recent research in mice has suggested (see Matthias Bluher, C. Ronald Kahn, Barbara B. Kahn, et al.) that it is not only reduced calorie intake which influences longevity. This was done by studying animals which have their metabolism changed to reduce activity of the hormone insulin or downstream elements in its signal transduction, consequently retaining the leanness of animals in the earlier studies. It was observed that these animals can have a normal dietary intake, but have a similarly increased lifespan. This suggests that lifespan is increased for an organism if it can remain lean and if it can avoid any excess accumulation of adipose tissue: if this can be done while not diminishing dietary intake (as in some minority eating patterns, see e.g. Living foods diet or Joel Fuhrman) then the 'starvation diet' anticipated as an impossible requirement by earlier researchers is no longer a precondition of increased longevity.
The extent to which these findings may apply to human nutrition and longevity is as noted above under investigation. A paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A. in 2003 showed that practitioners of a CR diet had significantly better cardiovascular health (PMID 15096581). Also in progress are the development of CR mimetic interventions.

Sir2 or "silent information regulator 2" is a longevity gene, discovered in baker's yeast cells, that extends lifespan by suppressing DNA instability (see Sinclair and Guarente, Cell, 1997).[30] In mammals Sir2 is known as SIRT1. Recent discoveries have suggested that the gene Sir2 might underlie the effect of CR. In baker's yeast the Sir2 enzyme is activated by CR, which leads to a 30% lifespan extension. David Sinclair at Harvard Medical School, Boston, showed that in mammals the SIRT1 gene is turned on by a CR diet, and this protects cells from dying under stress.[31] An article in the June 2004 issue of the journal Nature showed that SIRT1 releases fat from storage cells.[32]. Sinclair's lab reported that they have found small molecules (e.g. resveratrol) that activate Sir2/SIRT1 and extend the lifespan of yeast,[33] nematode worms, fruit flies,[34] and mice consuming a high caloric diet.[35] The effect of resveratrol on lifespan in C. elegans and Drosophila was recently re-investigated by D. Gems and L. Partridge. After performing the experiment numerous times, it was concluded that the lifespan extending effects of resveratrol are not consistent, and the previously reported lifespan increases were in fact due to natural variability in C. elegans lifespans (Effects of resveratrol on lifespan in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans.Mech Ageing Dev. 2007 Oct;128(10):546-52. Epub 2007 Aug 14.PMID: 17875315 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE). No lifespan extension in Drosophila was reported. A more recent study from Sinclair and De Cabo also concluded that resveratrol does not extend lifespan of normal mice (Resveratrol delays age-related deterioration and mimics transcriptional aspects of dietary restriction without extending life span.Cell Metab. 2008 Aug;8(2):157-68. Epub 2008 Jul 3.) An Italian group headed by Antonio Cellerino showed that resveratrol extends the lifespan of a vertebrate fish by 59%.[36] In the yeast, worm, and fly studies, resveratrol did not extend lifespan if the Sir2 gene was mutated. A group of researchers headed by Matthew Kaeberlein and Brian Kennedy (who just like Sinclair, were trained in the lab of L. Guarente) at the University of Washington Seattle believe that Sinclair's work on resveratrol is an artifact and that the Sir2 gene has no relevance to CR.[37]
Gurarente has recently published that behavior associated with caloric restriction did not occur when Sirt1 knockout mice were put on a calorie restricted diet, the implication being that Sirt1 is necessary for mediating the effects of caloric restriction. However, the same paper also reported that the biochemical parameters thought to mediate the lifespan extending effects of calorie restriction (reduced insulin, igf1 and fasting glucose), were no different in normal mice and mice lacking Sirt1. Whether the lifespan-extending effect of CR was still evident in Sirt1 knockout mice was not reported in that study.
According to Sinclair's data, Sirtuins (SirT1, Sir2, ...) are involved
