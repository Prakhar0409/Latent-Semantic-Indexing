Subaru Impreza WRX STI
The Subaru Impreza WRX STI (formerly WRX STi, officially changed in 2006) [1] is the highest standard-edition trim in the Subaru Impreza compact car line, produced by Japanese automaker Subaru.
In the late 1980s, Subaru created the Subaru Tecnica International (STI) division to coordinate development for the FIA World Rally Championship and other motorsports activities. After the company had grown, the division was used to create high-performance consumer versions of the Subaru Impreza WRX, an all-wheel drive car with a turbocharged flat-4 engine, leading to the development of the Impreza WRX STi. The Subaru World Rally Team has used a race-prepared version of the WRX STI as its rally platform since the model trim's creation.



The STi serve as the basis from which Group N "production" rally cars are constructed. Group N4-classed (marketed by FIA as Production Car World Rally Championship or PWRC) cars are the major support category for the World Rally Championship and are the premier category in many national rally championships. For the past two years (2004 and 2005), the WRX STi has taken the top 3 podiums in Group N. This new effort can be attributed to STi's increased support in Group N motorsports.

In 1995, 1996 and 1997 World Rally Championships, the Subaru World Rally Team, in conjunction with Prodrive won the WRC manufacturer's title with the World Rally Impreza. The STi's bare chassis is used by Prodrive as the basis of the World Rally Impreza. This WRC class is currently labeled by FIA as Group A8. Colin McRae in 1995, Richard Burns in 2001, and Petter Solberg in 2003 all won the WRC driver's title with the World Rally Impreza.

2006: Travis Pastrana drove a 2006MY STi to capture the national title overall, as well as in the Open Class. Several other teams entered driving STIs.
2007: Travis Pastrana drove a 2007MY STi to capture the national title overall, as well as in the Open Class.


2004: The STi Spec C won 1st place in the All Japan gymkhana (Japanese autocrossing) championships.

As of 2006, all GD-chassis STIs can compete in A Stock (AS), Street Touring Ultra (STU), B Street Prepared (BSP) and Street Modified (SM).
2005: At the Tire Rack SCCA Solo Nationals a 2004 US-spec STI took 1st in the STU class.
2006: At the Tire Rack SCCA ProSolo in Topeka, Kansas US-spec STIs took first place in AS and STU. At the Tire Rack Solo Nationals a 2004 US-spec STI took first place in STU.


2005: Chris Deeble took a STI-supported WRX STI to 2nd place in the A6 class and 14th overall in the 24-hour N眉rburgring race. The car was set up to have around -5 degrees of camber at the front wheels. The wheels are Enkei pieces. The car also uses the roof vane seen on the 2006MY WRX STI. The car used Tein SRC coilovers. The car was driven by Kazuo Shimizu (Super Taikyu driver and winner), Toshihiro Yoshida (Super Taikyu driver and winner), St茅phane Sarrazin (2005 Subaru World Rally Team driver) and Kumi Sato.[2]
2006: Deeble-Bellchambers {DB-RT} Racing UK campaigned a Subaru factory supported WRX STI Spec C in the 24 Hour N眉rburgring's SP 6 class. It had Motec Engine Management, 3-way adjustable AST coilovers, aftermarket Brembo brakes, an aftermarket turbocharger unit, STI Group N parts, aero pieces and many other modifications. It was pushing 400hp (300kW). To combat understeer, it ran without a front swaybar. It qualified 37th out of 225 competitors for the starting position. The Autosportif Racing UK/Subaru WRX STI Spec C managed to end with a position of 115 out of the 225. It had suffered 2 turbocharger unit failures during the course of the race. The car was driven by Alan van de Merwe (the 2003 British F3 champion), Briton Phil Bennett (driven in the BTCC, Le Mans and N眉rburgring), Jonathan Price (6-time N眉rburg 24 Hours competitor) and Chris deeble (2006, 2007 Subaru World Rally Team driver).[3]

2005: In Club Racing's T2 division, Icy Racing's 2004MY STis took 1st and 2nd place. ESX Motorsports announced the introduction of the WRX STI in World Challenge's GT class.
2006: Icy Racing's 2006MY STIs took 1st and 2nd place.

The Cusco team have been campaigning a heavily modified STi with rear drive conversion as required by regulations since the late nineties and having no two-door model available at present, the Super GT committee gave a special permit for them to race with a four-door model instead of two-door one. The rear drive conversion rule was lifted in 2006, and since then they return to AWD with a transaxle gearbox.
In 2008, Cusco's Impreza won the first GT300 race in Sepang, marked the first AWD car victory in Super GT/JGTC history. Even they were having very impressive result (with 1 win and 2 podiums) that season, the Cusco announced they are not participate in the 2009 season as they want to concentrate on off-road events.
As the performance of the Cusco was outstanding even they were using a 4-door car, it later leads the Super GT committee to officially allow all 4-door model cars to participate the series, and the Toyota Corolla Axio followed suit in 2009.



2005: Nobushige Kumakubo is the first to use an GD-chassis WRX STi at the D1 Grand Prix series. The car is extensively modified as regulations permit only two wheel drive cars. This STi is unique in that it is the first to locate a radiator (with the fan beside it) behind the driver rather than in front of the engine compartment as other cars usually do. His other Team Orange teammates, Kazuhiro Tanaka and Naoto Suenaga, soon followed suit.
2006: Team Orange and Jun Autosports have converted a GC-chassis 2-door STi into a RWD vehicle for drifting to be used by third driver Naoto Suenaga. Drivers Nobushige Kumakubo and Kazuhiro Tanaka took a single win each during the 2006 season and the former took the overall D1GP title.

The STI was originally sold only in Japan. It was later made officially available in Oceania (Australia had it in 1999 with the STi Version V). In 2001, Europe received the STi with the change of the chassis. After seeing the Impreza WRX sell at much better levels than expected,[citation needed] Subaru began selling the STI in North America in the spring-summer of 2003 as a 2004 model.
Oceania and Europe had WRX STis in the region before the official versions via grey-market importing.[citation needed]
Five (5) WRX STI S204 were made available to Subaru enthusiasts in New Zealand. However, unlike other S204s sent to other nations these five did not display either the in-cabin or in-enginebay badging that uniquely identifies each of the reported 600 vehicles manufactured.[citation needed] The lack of individual badging for these five cars brings into question the real number of S204s manufactured.[citation needed]
Thirty (30) WRX STI S204s' were made available to Singapore through the main distributor - Motor Image Enterprises.

There were six versions of the STi. The different versions were marketed with consecutive numbers. Another way to tell the version of a WRX STi was to look at the chassis code. Sedan STi Model Codes were GC8, Coupes were GM8 and Station Wagons were GF8, followed by a letter from A to G. There was a GC chassis version of the RS released in 2001 as well in the United States.
One common misconception is that every Impreza between 92-01 were "GC8's". The code breakdown is as follows; G - stands for Impreza, C - sedan, M - coupe, F - station wagon, The 8 stands for the 2.0L turbo motor. So really, there are many combinations. A coupe STi would be GM8, sedan GC8, wagon GF8. Also, the code for the coupe American 2.5RS's were GM6 (6 standing for the 2.5L N/A motor)
A JDM Sti Coupe has the code GC8. For example a version 4 Sti coupe has the code GC82DD. With the 2 representing 2-doors.


The first STi was known simply as "STi" (there was no "version" moniker added to the name until the version II). 100 Imprezas per month were produced starting from February 1994. In March, production was stabilized to 100 STis a month. It had 250PS (184kW; 247bhp) at 6500 rpm and 31.5 kgf路m (309 N路m) at 3500 rpm and weighed 1230kg (2,710 lb). Before the STi, the highest trimline of the Impreza was the WRX and the WRX RA, first manufactured in November 1992. This version of the STi was the only version where the standard cars were taken at the end of the assembly line and replaced by STi parts. After this version, the standard STi was built alongside the WRX on the production lines.
The WRX STi Type RA (marketing has made usage of the RA acronym in various ways; Record Attempt[4] is the current usage. "R = Racing, A = Group A, FIA the racing class the WRC Impreza competes in" has also been confirmed by Subaru of Japan; the correspondence can be seen on the discussion board for this article) produced 275PS (202kW; 271bhp) and 32.5 kgf路m (319 N路m) of torque. This version of the WRX STi was a stripped out car that had no sound-deadening, radio or air-conditioning. It came sparsely equipped as it was to be sold to racing teams that would throw out the cheap parts for racing parts. This version of the WRX came with a Driver Controlled Center Differential (DCCD). This device was an electromechanical differential that could lock the differential. The DCCD would be beneficial to people who used it in various rally conditions.

The regular STi's engine output stood at 275PS (202kW; 271bhp) and 32.5 kgf路m (319 N路m) of torque. This was the year that STi started painting the intake manifold red. The car weighed 1240kg (2734lb) and had gold wheels like the one on the World Rally Championship Impreza.
The V-limited STi edition was produced. It was a limited edition that was often used to celebrate a Manufacturer or Driver title award to Subaru's World Rally Team. The interior is colored blue on the seat inserts and carpeting. The WRX Type RA STi received a radio and air-conditioning in the V-limited form. 1000 WRX STi Version 2 V-limited were produced. 555 (the cigarette brand that was the premier sponsor of the Subaru World Rally Team and became synonymous with the Impreza WRC livery) WRX Type RA STi Version 2 V-limited were produced. And that's that.

The engine was vastly updated and was given the name Boxer Master 4. It developed about 300PS but output was reported at the then-established gentlemen's agreement power limit of 280PS (276hp/206kW). Torque peaked at 4000 rpm with a value of 35.0 kgf路m (343 N路m). Standard this version has a top speed of over 240km. The car gained 10 more kilograms and weighed at 1250kg (2756lb). The STi shared the same face lift that the rest of the Impreza line received.
With Version III came the start of the coupe version of the WRX STi. It is called the WRX Type R STi. The coupe was chosen by Prodrive for use in the WRC because it was smaller, lighter and stiffer than the 4-door version. It was essentially a 2-door version of the WRX Type RA STi meaning it had DCCD, minimal sound insulation, close-gear ratios and hardened gearbox. This car also has a water-spray nozzle to dampen the top of the intercooler. The water will then evaporate, taking heat away from the intercooler and cooling the intake charge. This car was produced on an order-only basis.
Also there was WRX STI type RA (4-door) available in Version 3, they have the same motor, gearbox and R180 diff as the Version 3 WRX STI Type R, including DCCD, aluminium bonnet and front guards, no sound deadening and thinner glass. The ECU is also an exclusive tune. The Type R tends to be a bit stiffer and weighs 1190kg (2624lb). The DCCD has been known to bite new drivers in the wet. The RA gets a roof vent, instead of map lights, and wind up windows, although electrics are an option from factory.
Also available was a WRX Type R V-limited, in version 3. It has a WRX motor with no forged internals like the STI, and it misses out on the 4 pot front brakes as they are to be installed by rally teams. It has a roof vent and is lightweight, making a good base for a rally car.
Version 3 STI runs a VF23 IHI ball bearing turbocharger while the JDM non-STI gets a VF22.

Power remained at 280bhp
The interior and the cockpit were changed into a newer design along with the new "white color" guages.

The power stayed the same as the previous version. The engine layout and design was made cleaner and was dubbed as the Boxer Phase 2 engine. The facelift the rest of the Impreza line had was also applied to the STi. The WRX STi weighed 1270kg (2800lb). There were 1000 WRX Type RA STi Version 5 Limited cars and the WRX Type R STi Version 5 Limited cars had a 4 month waiting period for each order. The interior was also changed slightly from the Version 4 including seats and steering.This model was also produced as a 555 limited edition.
