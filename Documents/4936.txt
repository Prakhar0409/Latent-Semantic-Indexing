Beijing
 Beijing (helpÂ·info) (pronounced /beÉªËˆdÊ’ÉªÅ‹/ or /beÉªËˆÊ’ÉªÅ‹/ in English; Chinese: åŒ—äº¬; pinyin: BÄ›ijÄ«ng; IPA: [pÃ¨itÉ•Ã­Å‹]; Wade-Giles: Peiching or Pei-ching) (also formerly known in English as Peking (/piËËˆkÉªÅ‹/listen (info) or /peÉªËˆkÉªÅ‹/)) is a metropolis in northern China and the capital of the People's Republic of China. It is one of the four municipalities of the PRC, which are equivalent to provinces in China's administrative structure. The municipality of Beijing borders Hebei Province to the north, west, south, and for a small section in the east, and Tianjin Municipality to the southeast.[6] Beijing is one of the Four Great Ancient Capitals of China.[7]
Beijing is China's second largest city, after Shanghai.[8] Beijing is a major transportation hub, with dozens of railways, roads and motorways passing through the city. It is also the focal point of many international flights to China. Beijing is recognised as the political, educational, and cultural center of the People's Republic of China,[8] while Shanghai and Hong Kong predominate in economic fields.[9][10][11] The city hosted the 2008 Olympic Games.
Few cities in the world besides Beijing have served as the political and cultural centre of an area as immense as China for so long.[12] The EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica describes it as, "One of the world's great cities,"[13] and declares that the city has been an integral part of Chinaâ€™s history for centuries, and there is scarcely a major building of any age in Beijing that doesn't have at least some national historical significance.[12] Beijing is renowned for its opulent palaces, temples, and huge stone walls and gates.[14] Its art treasures and universities have long made the city a centre of culture and art in China.[14]

Beijing or Peking (åŒ—äº¬) means "northern capital", in line with the common East Asian tradition whereby capital cities are explicitly named as such. Other cities that are similarly named include Nanjing (å—äº¬), China, meaning "southern capital"; Tokyo (æ±äº¬), Japan, and ÄÃ´ng Kinh (Chinese: æ±äº¬, now Hanoi), Vietnam, both meaning "eastern capital"; as well as Kyoto (äº¬éƒ½), Japan, and Gyeongseong (äº¬åŸ; now Seoul), Korea, both meaning simply "capital".
Peking is the name of the city according to Chinese Postal Map Romanization, and the traditional customary name for Beijing in English (passports issued by the British Embassy are still printed as being issued by the "British Embassy, Peking"). The term Peking originated with French missionaries four hundred years ago and corresponds to an older pronunciation predating a subsequent sound change in Mandarin from [kÊ²] to [tÉ•][15] ([tÉ•] is represented in pinyin as j, as in Beijing). It is still used in many languages.
The pronunciation "Peking" is also closer to the Fujianese dialect of Amoy or Min Nan spoken in the city of Xiamen, a port where European traders first landed in the 16th century, while "Beijing" more closely approximates the Mandarin dialect's pronunciation.[16]
The city has been renamed several times. During the Jin Dynasty, the city was known as Zhongdu (ä¸­éƒ½) , and then later under the Mongol Yuan Dynasty as Dadu (å¤§éƒ½) in Chinese[17] and Daidu to Mongols[18] (also recorded as Cambuluc[8] by Marco Polo). Twice in the city's history, the name was changed from Beijing (Peking) to Beiping (Peiping) (åŒ—å¹³ Pinyin: Beiping; Wade-Giles: Pei-p'ing), literally "Northern Peace". This occurred first under the Hongwu Emperor of the Ming Dynasty, and again in 1928 with the Kuomintang (KMT) government of the Republic of China.[8] On each occasion, the name change removed the element meaning "capital" (jing or king, Chinese: äº¬) to reflect the fact the national capital had changed to Nanjing. The city's name was also twice changed from Beiping (Peiping) to Beijing (Peking). This occurred first under the Yongle Emperor of the Ming Dynasty, who moved the capital from Nanjing back to Beijing, and again in 1949, when the Communist Party of China restored Beijing as China's capital after the founding of the People's Republic of China.[8]
Yanjing (ç‡•äº¬; Pinyin: YÄnjÄ«ng; Wade-Giles: Yen-ching) is and has been another popular informal name for Beijing, a reference to the ancient State of Yan that existed here during the Zhou Dynasty. This name is reflected in the locally brewed Yanjing Beer as well as Yenching University, an institution of higher learning that was merged into Peking University.


The earliest remnants of human habitation in the Beijing municipality are found in the caves of Dragon Bone Hill near the village of Zhoukoudian in Fangshan District, where the Peking Man lived. Homo erectus fossils from the caves date to 230,000 to 250,000 years ago. Paleolithic homo sapiens also lived there about 27,000 years ago.[19] There were cities in the vicinities of Beijing by the 1st millennium BC, and the capital of the State of Yan, one of the powers of the Warring States Period (473-221 BC), Ji (è–Š/è“Ÿ), was established in present-day Beijing.[1]
After the fall of the Yan, the subsequent Qin, Han, and Jin dynasties set up local prefectures in the area.[1] During the fall of the Han, it was the seat of the warlord Gongsun Zan. In Tang Dynasty it became the headquarters for Fanyang jiedushi, the virtual military governor of current northern Hebei area. The An Shi Rebellion was also launched from here in 755 AD.

In 936, the Later Jin Dynasty (936-947) of northern China ceded a large part of its northern frontier, including modern Beijing, to the Khitan Liao Dynasty. In 938, the Liao Dynasty set up a secondary capital in what is now Beijing, and called it Nanjing (the "Southern Capital"). In 1125, the Jurchen Jin Dynasty conquered Liao, and in 1153 moved its capital to Liao's Nanjing, calling it Zhongdu (ä¸­éƒ½), the "central capital."[1] Zhongdu was situated in what is now the area centered around Tianningsi, slightly to the southwest of central Beijing. Some of the oldest existing relics in Beijing, such as the Tianning Temple, date to the Liao era.
Mongol forces burned Zhongdu to the ground in 1215.[20] Later in 1264, in preparation for the conquest of all of China to establish the Yuan Dynasty, Kublai Khan decided to rebuild it slightly north to the center of the Jin capital,[21] and in 1272, he made this city his capital as Dadu (å¤§éƒ½, Chinese for "great capital"),[20] or Daidu to the Mongols, otherwise spelled as Cambaluc or Cambuluc in Marco Polo's accounts. Construction of Dadu finished in 1293.[1] The decision of Kublai Khan greatly enhanced the status of a city that had been situated on the northern fringe of China proper. The center of Dadu was situated slightly north of modern central Beijing. It centered on what is now the northern stretch of the 2nd Ring Road, and stretched northwards to between the 3rd and 4th Ring Roads. There are remnants of the Yuan-era wall still standing, and they are known as the Tucheng (åœŸåŸ literally, the 'earth wall').[22]
