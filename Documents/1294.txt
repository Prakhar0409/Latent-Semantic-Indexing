Iraq
Iraq (pronounced /ÉªËˆrÃ¦k/ or /iËˆrÉ‘Ëk/; Arabic: Ø§Ù„Ø¹Ø±Ø§Ù‚ Al-Ê¾IrÄq), officially the Republic of Iraq (Arabic:  Ø¬Ù…Ù‡ÙˆØ±ÙŠØ© Ø§Ù„Ø¹Ø±Ø§Ù‚ (helpÂ·info) JumhÅ«rÄ«yat Al-Ê¾IrÄq, Kurdish: ÙƒÛ†Ù…Ø§Ø±ÛŒ Ø¹ÛØ±Ø§Ù‚â€, Komara IraqÃª[1]), is a country in Western Asia spanning most of the northwestern end of the Zagros mountain range, the eastern part of the Syrian Desert and the northern part of the Arabian Desert.[3] It shares borders with Kuwait and Saudi Arabia to the south, Jordan to the west, Syria to the northwest, Turkey to the north, and Iran to the east. It has a very narrow section of coastline measuring 58 km (35 miles) between Umm Qasr and Al Faw on the Persian Gulf. There are two major flowing rivers: the Tigris and the Euphrates. These provide Iraq with agriculturally capable land and contrast with the desert landscape that covers most of Western Asia.
The capital city, Baghdad (Arabic: Ø¨ØºØ¯Ø§Ø¯â€ BaÄ¡dÄd), is in the center-east. Iraq's rich history dates back to ancient Mesopotamia. The region between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers is identified as the cradle of civilization and a birthplace of writing. Throughout its long history, Iraq has been the center of the Akkadian, Assyrian, Babylonian, and Abbasid empires, and part of the Achaemenid, Macedonian, Parthian, Sassanid, Roman, Rashidun, Umayyad, Mongol, Ottoman and British empires.[4][5]
Beginning with the invasion in 2003, a multinational coalition of forces, mainly American and British, occupied Iraq. Under the Laws of War and UNSCR 1483, the occupying Coalition Provisional Authority completed the transfer of sovereignty on June 28, 2004 to the Iraqi Interim Government in accordance with UNSCR 1546, formally ending the "occupation." Elections on January 30, 2005 created the Iraqi Transitional Government, which drafted the Constitution of Iraq, approved by referendum on October 25, 2005. Under this new Constitution, elections chose a new Iraqi National Assembly to form the Government of Iraq. Some dispute whether Iraq is de facto sovereign (see Iraqi sovereignty, United States-Iraq relations).
The invasion has had wide-reaching consequences: increased civil violence, establishment of a parliamentary democracy, the removal and execution of former authoritarian President Saddam Hussein, official recognition and widespread political participation of Iraq's Kurdish minority and Shi'ite Arab majority, persecution of Christian and Mandaean minorities, significant economic growth, destruction of existing infrastructure, and use of the country's huge reserves of oil. In 2008 the Failed States Index, produced by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace's Foreign Policy magazine and the Fund for Peace, Iraq was the world's fifth most unstable country,[6] after Sudan,[7] and the United States in 2007 referred to it in court proceedings as "an active theater of combat."[8] Iraq is developing a parliamentary democracy composed of 18 governorates (known as muhafadhat).

The origin of the name Iraq (Arabic: Ø§Ù„Ø¹Ø±Ø§Ù‚ 'al-â€˜IrÄq, Assyrian: Ü¥ÜªÜÜ©, Kurdish: Ø¹ÛØ±Ø§Ù‚, Turkish: Irak) is disputed. There are several suggested origins for the name. One dates to the Sumerian city of Uruk (or Erech), meaning "between the rivers";[9] another maintains according to Professor Wilhelm Eilers, "The name al-â€˜IrÄq, for all its Arabic appearance, is derived from Middle Persian erÄq lowlands".[10] According to some, the escarpment (i.e. "el-'Iraq") at the south and east of the Jazira Plateau, which forms the northern and western edge of the "el-Iraq arabi" area, is the origin of the name.[11] In Turkish the word 'Irak' means 'far away'.[citation needed]
Under the Persian Sassanid dynasty, there was a region called "Erak Arabi," referring to the part of the south western region of the Persian Empire that is now part of southern Iraq. The name Al-Iraq was used by the Arabs themselves, from the 6th century, for the land Iraq covers.[citation needed] The term Iraq historically included the plain south of Hamrin Mountains and did not include the Kurdish-inhabited areas which after establishment of the country of Iraq were included as part of the republic.[12]
The Arabic pronunciation is [Ê•iËˆrÉ‘Ëq]. In English, the name is pronounced as either [Éª.ËˆÉ¹É‘(Ë)k] (the only pronunciation listed in the Oxford English Dictionary and the first one in Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary) or [Éª.ËˆÉ¹Ã¦k] (listed first by MQD), the American Heritage Dictionary, and the Random House Dictionary.

Iraq is located at 33Â°00â€²N 44Â°00â€²Eï»¿ / ï»¿33Â°N 44Â°Eï»¿ / 33; 44. Spanning 437,072 kmÂ² (168,743 sq mi), it is the 58th-largest country in the world. It is comparable in size to the US state of California, and somewhat larger than Paraguay.
Iraq mainly consists of desert, but near the two major rivers (Euphrates and Tigris) are fertile alluvial plains, as the rivers carry about 60 million cubic metres (78 million cu. yd) of silt annually to the delta. The north of the country is mostly composed of mountains; the highest point being at 3,611 metres (11,847 ft) point, unnamed on the map opposite, but known locally as Cheekah Dar (black tent). Iraq has a small coastline measuring 58 km (35 miles) along the Persian Gulf. Close to the coast and along the Shatt al-Arab (known as arvandrÅ«d: Ø§Ø±ÙˆÙ†Ø¯Ø±ÙˆØ¯ among Iranians) there u
